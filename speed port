speed port
Function

The speed port command sets a fixed rate for an interface on an RU.

The undo speed port command restores the default rate of an interface on an RU.

By default, an interface on an RU works at the rate of 1000 Mbit/s.
Format

speed { 10 | 100 | 1000 | 2500 } port { portid1 [ to portid2 ] } &<1-32>

undo speed { 10 | 100 | 1000 | 2500 } port { portid1 [ to portid2 ] } &<1-32>
Parameters

10
	

Sets the interface rate to 10 Mbit/s.
	

-

100

-

1000
	

Sets the interface rate to 1000 Mbit/s.
	

-

2500
	

Sets the interface rate to 2500 Mbit/s.
	

-

{ portid1 [ to portid2 ] }
	

Specifies the index of an interface on an RU.

Usage Guidelines

In non-auto negotiation mode, if interfaces on two connected devices work at different rates, the two devices cannot communicate with each other. In this case, you need to run this command to change the rates of the interfaces to be the same.

Prerequisites

The undo negotiation auto port command has been run to configure the interface to work in non-auto-negotiation mode.

Follow-up procedure

After running this command, run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.
Example

# Configure interface 2 on RU 0 to work at the rate of 100 Mbit/s in non-auto-negotiation mode.
