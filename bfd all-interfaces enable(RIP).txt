Usage Guidelines

If BFD parameters are configured, but the bfd all-interfaces enable command is not configured, BFD sessions cannot be established.

    The BFD priority on an interface is higher than the BFD priority on a RIP process.

    If the rip bfd block command is configured on an interface, the bfd all-interfaces enable command cannot be used to enable BFD on the interface.
