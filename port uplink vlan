port uplink vlan
Function

The port uplink vlan command configures allowed VLANs for the uplink interface on an RU.

The undo port uplink vlan command deletes the allowed VLAN configuration of the uplink interface on an RU.

By default, the uplink interface of an RU allows packets from VLAN 1 to pass through.
Format

port uplink { tagged | untagged } vlan { vlan-id1 [ to vlan-id2 ] } &<1-10>

undo port uplink { tagged | untagged } { vlan { vlan-id1 [ to vlan-id2 ] } &<1-10> | all }

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If a downlink interface of an RU is configured with a default VLAN, the uplink interface must allow packets of this VLAN to pass through, so that service traffic can be forwarded normally.

An RU saves the VLAN configuration delivered by the central switch to it in its flash memory and forwards traffic based on this VLAN configuration after being powered on. After the RU goes online on the central switch, the central switch synchronizes the latest VLAN configuration to the RU's flash memory.

Prerequisites

You have run the vlan mode manual command to configure the manual VLAN mode for the RU.

Follow-up Procedure

After you run the commands for configuring the VLAN mode for an RU and VLANs for RU interfaces, run the commit command to deliver the VLAN configuration to the RU or bring the RU offline and then online again for the configuration to take effect.
Example

# Configure the uplink interface on RU 0 to forward packets of VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 in tagged mode.

[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
[HUAWEI-remote-unit-0] port uplink tagged vlan  10 20
