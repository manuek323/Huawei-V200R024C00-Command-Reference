Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

You can run the display remote-unit port poe command to view PoE running information about interfaces on an RU, including the current power, class of the power device (PD) connected to each interface, reference power of the PD, and power supply status.

If no parameter is specified, the PoE running information about all interfaces on all RUs is displayed.

Precautions

    An uplink 2.5GE optical interface of an RU does not support a copper module, and supports only a GE or 2.5GE optical module. In V200R022C10 and earlier versions, the uplink interface configured with a GE optical module can connect to a central switch only when it works at the rate of 1 Gbit/s. In V200R023C00 and later versions, the uplink interface configured with a 2.5GE optical module can connect to a central switch when it works at the rate of 2.5 Gbit/s. After the rate of the uplink interface is changed, the RU automatically restarts for the change to take effect.
    An uplink 2.5GE hybrid optical-electrical interface of an RU does not support a copper module, and supports only a GE or 2.5GE optical or hybrid module. In V200R022C10 and earlier versions, the uplink interface configured with a GE optical or hybrid module can connect to a central switch only when it works at the rate of 1 Gbit/s. In V200R023C00 and later versions, the uplink interface configured with a 2.5GE optical or hybrid module can connect to a central switch when it works at the rate of 2.5 Gbit/s. After the rate of the uplink interface is changed, the RU automatically restarts for the change to take effect.
