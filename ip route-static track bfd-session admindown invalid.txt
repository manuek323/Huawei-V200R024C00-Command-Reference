ip route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid
Function

The ip route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command disables a switch from selecting a static route if the BFD session associated with the route is in the AdminDown state.

The undo ip route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command restores the default configuration.

By default, a static route can participate in route selection even if its bound BFD session is in the AdminDown state.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

By default, if a BFD session associated with a static route is in the AdminDown state, the route can participate in route selection on Huawei switches, but is not allowed for route selection on some non-Huawei devices. As a result, Huawei switches cannot communicate with such non-Huawei devices.

To address this problem, run the ip route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command to configure the device not to select the static route if its bound BFD session is in the AdminDown state.

Prerequisites

The BFD session specified by bfd-name has been created.
Example

# Disable a switch from selecting a static route if the BFD session associated with the route is in AdminDown state.
