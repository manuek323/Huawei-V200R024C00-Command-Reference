poe anti-interference frequency
Function

The poe anti-interference frequency command configures the PoE anti-interference frequency for an RU.

The undo poe anti-interference frequency command restores the default configuration.

By default, the PoE anti-interference frequency of an RU is 50 Hz.

Only PoE-capable RUs support this command.
Format

poe anti-interference frequency { 50 | 60 }

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The mains frequency varies in different countries and regions. Some are 60 Hz and some are 50 Hz. When RUs provide PoE power supply, incorrect grounding may occur. As a result, industrial frequency interference is coupled to network cables, resulting in abnormal PoE detection classification. You can run the poe anti-interference frequency command to modify the filtering algorithm on the PoE port to make the PoE anti-interference frequency become the same as the mains frequency, reducing the impact of the mains frequency on PD detection.

Follow-up Procedure

After configuring the PoE anti-interference frequency for an RU, you need to run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.

Precautions

If this command is configured in both the remote-unit view and remote-unit N view, the configuration in the remote-unit N view takes effect.
Example

# Set the PoE anti-interference frequency of RU 0 to 60 Hz.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
[HUAWEI-remote-unit-0] poe anti-interference frequency 60
