poe enable port
Function

The poe enable port command sets the power supply mode for an interface on an RU.

The undo poe enable port command restores the default power supply mode of a PoE interface on an RU.

By default, interfaces supporting the PoE++ mode provide power in that mode (also referred to as the bt-inrush mode). Interfaces that do not support the PoE++ mode provide power in at-inrush mode.
Format

poe { at-inrush | af-inrush } enable port port-id

undo poe { at-inrush | af-inrush } enable port port-id

The following RUs work in PoE++ mode by default:

S5731-L4P2HW-RUA, S5731S-L4P2HW-RUA, S5731-L4P2S-RUA, S5731S-L4P2S-RUA, S5731-L4P2ST-RUA, S5731S-L4P2ST-RUA, S5731-L4P2HT-RUA, S5731S-L4P2HT-RUA

The following RUs work in PoE+ mode by default:

S5731-L8P2ST-RUA, S5731S-L8P2ST-RUA, S5731-L8P2HT-RUA, S5731S-L8P2HT-RUA, S5731-L8LP2ST-RUA, S5751-L8LP2X-RUA, S5751-L8LP2J-RUA, S5751-L8P2X-RUA, S5751-L8P2J-RUA, S5751-L8P2HX-RUA, S5751-L8P2HJ-RUA, S5751-L8P2PN2J-RUA, S5751-L8P2PN2X-RUA, S5751-L8P2PN2HX-RUA, S5751-L24P2J-RUA, S5751-L24P2X-RUA, S5751-L24P2PN2X-RUA
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

poe at-inrush
	

Sets an RU interface to work in PoE+ power supply mode.
	

-

poe af-inrush
	

Sets an RU interface to work in 802.3af power supply mode.
	

-

port-id
	

Specifies the index of an interface on an RU.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 32. If the specified interface index is larger than the largest one on the RU, the command is not issued to the RU.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To power the PDs requiring the standard power supply mode, you can run the poe at-inrush enable command. This command configures PoE interfaces to work in PoE+ power supply mode. Some non-IEEE standard PDs do not support high-current power supply, and instead only support low-current power supply. To power on such non-standard PDs, you can run the poe af-inrush enable command to configure PoE interfaces on RUs to work in 802.3af power supply mode.

Follow-up procedure

After running this command, run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.

Precautions

Switching the PoE power supply mode of an RU interface between the at-inrush and bt-inrush modes will cause PDs to be powered off.
Example

# Set interface 1 on RU 0 to work in PoE+ power supply mode.
