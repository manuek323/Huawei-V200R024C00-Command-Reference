Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command is used on a DHCP server. Besides assigning IP addresses, a DHCP server can also provide the required network configuration parameters, such as the startup configuration file name for the DHCP clients. After the startup configuration file name is configured using the bootfile command, the Offer and ACK packets sent from the DHCP server carry this file name. The DHCP client can acquire the startup configuration file from the specified server based on the file name.

Precautions

Usually, the startup configuration file is saved on a specified file server. Therefore, the route between the DHCP client and the file server must be reachable and the ip address or name of the file server must be specified.
Example
# In the IP address pool view, configure the name of the startup configuration file as start.ini for the DHCP client.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ip pool p1
[HUAWEI-ip-pool-p1] bootfile start.ini

# In the DHCP Option template view, configure the name of the startup configuration file as start.ini for the DHCP client.

Views

IP address pool view
Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command is used on a DHCP server. When a DHCP server allocates IP addresses to clients, IP address conflict may occur because IP addresses of some hosts have been manually configured. In this case, the DHCP server considers these IP addresses as conflicting IP addresses, and allocates available IP addresses from the conflicting IP addresses to clients only after available IP addresses in the address pool are used up. To reclaim conflicting IP addresses promptly, the administrator can run the conflict auto-recycle interval command to enable automatic reclaim and specify the reclaim interval.

Prerequisites

The global address pool has been created using the ip pool command.
Example

# Enable automatic reclaim for conflicting IP addresses in the global address pool global1, and set the interval for automatic reclaim to one day.

<HUAWEI> system-view 
[HUAWEI] ip pool global1 
[HUAWEI-ip-pool-global1] conflict auto-recycle interval day 1

dhcp anti-attack check duplicate option
Function

The dhcp anti-attack check duplicate option command enables the device to check and discard DHCP messages with duplicate options.

By default, the device is disabled from checking and discarding DHCP messages with duplicate options.
Format

dhcp anti-attack check duplicate option [ option-start [ to option-end ] ] &<1-254>

undo dhcp anti-attack check duplicate option [ option-start [ to option-end ] ] &<1-254>
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

option-start [ to option-end ]
	

Specifies the option value.

    option-start: Specifies the start value of an option in a DHCP packet.
    option-end: Specifies the end value of an option in a DHCP packet.

	

The value is an integer in the range 1 to 254. For an option, the end value must be larger than the start value.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The dhcp anti-attack check udp-checksum command applies to DHCP servers, DHCP relay agents, DHCP clients, and DHCP snooping-enabled devices. Devices from different vendors may use different DHCP implementation mechanisms. After checking the UDP header checksum in a received DHCP packet, a device may not allow the DHCP packet to pass through and discards the packet. As a result, DHCP becomes unavailable. To solve this problem, you can run the undo dhcp anti-attack check udp-checksum command to disable the function of checking the UDP header checksum in a DHCP packet, so that a DHCP packet with an incorrect UDP header checksum can be properly forwarded.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled on the device using the dhcp enable command.
Example

# Disable the function of checking the UDP header checksum in a DHCP packet.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] dhcp enable

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If the DHCP relay or DHCP server function is enabled on a VLANIF interface of a device, the DHCP broadcast messages (DHCP Discover and DHCP Request messages) received on the VLANIF interface are broadcast among all the physical interfaces in the corresponding VLAN. If a large number of DHCP clients go online, each physical interface receives a large number of DHCP broadcast messages, affecting the device performance. In this case, you can run the dhcp broadcast suppress enable command to enable the DHCP broadcast suppression function, so that the DHCP broadcast messages are not broadcast among the interfaces that do not receive these messages.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled globally using the dhcp enable command.

Precautions

In VRRP master/backup scenarios, DHCP broadcast suppression must be disabled so that the backup device can broadcast received DHCP traffic to the master device and IP addresses can be allocated to users through DHCP.
Example

# Enable the DHCP broadcast suppression function.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] dhcp enable
[HUAWEI] dhcp broadcast suppress enable

dhcp client class-id (interface view)

Usage Guidelines

This command applies to the following scenarios:

    Manually renewing the lease

    If a DHCP server assigns the original IP address to the client, only the lease is renewed. If another DHCP server assigns an IP address to the client, the client obtains a new IP address and related network parameters.

    Updating the IP address

    When the DHCP client is migrated from a network segment to another network segment and the original IP address lease does not expire, the client needs to update the IP address.

After the dhcp client renew command is run, the DHCP client sends a lease renewal request to the DHCP server.

    If the DHCP client receives a positive reply from the server, the client updates the parameters such as the lease duration.
    If the DHCP client receives a negative reply from the server, the client releases the applied parameters and re-applies to the DHCP server for an IP address and other network parameters.
    If no reply is received, the client does not perform any operation.

The dhcp client renew command can be normally run only after the DHCP client function is enabled on the interface and an IP address is obtained.
Example

# Renew the IP address lease on VLANIF100.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

As the network scale expands and the network complexity increases, network configurations become more and more complex. For example, computers frequently change their locations, and IP addresses are insufficient for these computers. The DHCP protocol is developed to address these problems. The dhcp enable command enables the DHCP function on the device.

Precautions

The dhcp enable command is the prerequisite for configuring DHCP-related functions, including DHCP relay, DHCP snooping, and DHCP server. These functions take effect only after the dhcp enable command is run. After the undo dhcp enable command is run, all DHCP-related configurations of the device are deleted. After DHCP is enabled again using the dhcp enable command, all DHCP-related configurations of the device are restored to the default configurations.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In a distributed VXLAN gateway scenario, the DHCP relay function is configured on VBDIF interfaces of distributed gateways. The value of the GIADDR field carried in a request packet sent from a DHCP relay agent to the DHCP server is the IP address of the VBDIF interface. When returning a response packet, the DHCP server figures out the network segment on which the DHCP client resides based on information of this field. However, the response packet from the DHCP server may be forwarded to other distributed gateways (rather than the device that sends the request packet) because IP addresses of VBDIF interfaces on distributed gateways are the same. As a result, the user cannot obtain an IP address.

To resolve the preceding problem, you can enable the re-routing function for DHCP relay agents on VBDIF interfaces of the distributed gateways. After this function is enabled, when a DHCP relay agent sends a request packet, the VTEP IP address of the local device, functioning as the return IP address, is carried in the Option82 field; when a DHCP relay agent returns a response packet, the VTEP IP address of the local device is also carried in the packet. When processing a response packet from the DHCP server, the DHCP relay agent figures out whether the response packet corresponds to the request packet sent from the local device based on the return IP address carried in the packet. If so, the DHCP relay agent forwards the packet to the client. If not, the DHCP relay agent performs re-routing based on the return IP address to forward the response packet to the corresponding distributed gateway through a VXLAN tunnel.

Prerequisites

The DHCP relay function has been enabled using the dhcp select relay command in the VBDIF interface view.

Precautions
Because the return IP address is carried in the Option82 field, you need to perform the following operations:

    Run the dhcp option82 vendor-specific format vendor-sub-option 2 ip-address ip-address command in the system view to use the Sub Option2 field that is customized by the vendor in the Option82 field to carry the VTEP IP address of the local device.
    Run the dhcp option82 encapsulation vendor-specific-id command in the BD view to insert the sub-option customized by the vendor into the Option82 field.
    Run the dhcp option82 { insert | rebuild } enable command in the BD view to configure the Option82 field to be inserted into DHCP packets.
    (Optional) Run the dhcp relay information enable command in the VBDIF interface view to enable the Option 82 function for the DHCP relay agent.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command is used on a DHCP server. During network deployment, a DHCP server dynamically allocates IP addresses with leases to clients or allocates fixed IP addresses to some clients. For example, laptops or terminals are often moved to different places in enterprises, and they can obtain IP addresses using the dynamic allocation mode. However, IP addresses obtained dynamically are randomly allocated, and cannot be set to specified IP addresses. To allocate fixed IP addresses to some fixed terminals (such as IP phones), run the static-bind command in the global address view to bind IP addresses to MAC addresses of the clients so that the clients are allocated fixed IP addresses.

In some cases, you need to allocate other network configuration parameters except IP addresses to fixed static terminals. For example, besides obtaining an IP address, an IP phone needs information such as the startup configuration file to register normally. In this case, you can configure a DHCP Option template and configure network configuration parameters except the IP address required by the client in the DHCP Option template. Then bind the DHCP Option template to the fixed terminal in the global address pool. The DHCP server then allocates the IP address and other parameters to the terminal.

Precautions

Network parameters configured in the DHCP Option template view take effect only for static clients. A DHCP Option template can be bound to multiple clients. Run the static-bind ip-address ip-address mac-address mac-address [ option-template template-name ] command to configure a DHCP Option template that is bound to static clients.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The dhcp relay gateway-switch enable command is used on DHCP relay agents. This command allows a DHCP relay agent to use a secondary IP address as the gateway address to apply for IP addresses for users when it has failed to use the primary IP address to apply for user IP addresses.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled globally by using the dhcp enable command in the system view. DHCP relay has been enabled on an interface by using the dhcp select relay command.

Precautions

    After VRRP is configured, if the interface (enabled with DHCP relay) has a primary IP address and several secondary IP addresses, the DHCP relay agent by default uses the virtual IP address first configured for the VRRP group to apply for IP addresses for users. If IP addresses fail to be applied for, the DHCP relay agent tries other virtual IP addresses of the VRRP group one by one based on the VRRP virtual IP address configuration sequence until users successfully obtain IP addresses.
    The DHCP relay agent switches the gateway address from the primary to a secondary IP address only when it has failed to apply an IP address for a user using the primary IP address at least three times and the interval between the first and last failures exceeds 24 seconds.
    Before running this command on an interface, ensure that the interface has a primary IP address and at least one secondary IP address.
    An interface can have a primary IP address and several secondary IP addresses. The system tries the secondary IP addresses one by one based on the IP address configuration sequence until users successfully obtain IP addresses.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

On a network with distributed VXLAN gateways where VBDIF interfaces are enabled with the DHCP relay function, a distributed gateway (as a DHCP relay agent) fills the IP address of its VBDIF interface in the giaddr field of a DHCP DISCOVER message to be sent to DHCP servers. When replying with a DHCP OFFER message, a DHCP server sets the destination IP address to the IP address of the VBDIF interface in the giaddr field carried in its received DHCP DISCOVER message. However, since the IP addresses of VBDIF interfaces on different distributed gateways are the same, the DHCP OFFER message from a DHCP server may be forwarded to a distributed gateway rather than the one relaying the DHCP DISCOVER message received by the server. As a result, the user sending the DHCP DISCOVER message cannot obtain an IP address.

To resolve this issue, you can configure a source interface for relayed DHCP messages on VBDIF interfaces of all distributed gateways. The distributed gateways (as DHCP relay agents) then fill the primary IP address of the specified source interface in the giaddr field of DHCP DISCOVER messages to be relayed to DHCP servers. Since the primary IP address of the source interface configured on each VBDIF interface is unique among all distributed gateways, as long as this IP address is reachable to DHCP servers, the DHCP OFFER messages from DHCP servers can be sent to the correct distributed gateways.

Prerequisites

DHCP relay has been enabled using the dhcp select relay command in the VBDIF interface view.

Follow-up Procedure

By default, a DHCP server selects an IP address from the address pool on the network segment specified in the giaddr field of its received DHCP DISCOVER messages. After this command is run to configure a source interface for relayed DHCP messages on a DHCP relay-enabled interface (which is the gateway for its downlink DHCP clients), the primary IP address of the specified source interface is filled in the giaddr field of DHCP DISCOVER messages destined for DHCP servers. If DHCP servers still select an IP address from the address pool on the network segment specified in the giaddr field, DHCP clients cannot access the network after obtaining IP addresses. This is because the primary IP address of the source interface is on a different network segment from that of the DHCP relay-enabled interface. To resolve the preceding problem, you need to run the dhcp relay information link-selection insert enable command to insert the Link-selection sub-option of the Option82 field into relayed DHCP DISCOVER messages, and to fill the IP address of the DHCP relay-enabled interface in the Link-selection suboption. In this case, DHCP servers select IP addresses from the address pool on the network segment specified in the Link-selection sub-option of the Option 82 field of their received DHCP DISCOVER messages.

Precautions

    The primary IP address of the source interface for relayed DHCP messages must be reachable to DHCP servers.
    The source interface and VBDIF interfaces enabled with the DHCP relay function can be bound to different VPNs.
    The DHCP server must be able to parse the Link-selection sub-option.

Example
# On VBDIF 100, configure Loopback 1 as the source interface for relayed DHCP messages.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to the DHCP relay agent. When DHCP Request messages carry Option 82 information, the DHCP server can locate user positions accurately and assign IP addresses to users using different policies. After the Option 82 function is enabled on the DHCP relay agent, the device checks the Option 82 field contained in the packets and processes the packets using corresponding policies.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled by running the dhcp enable command in the system view.

DHCP relay has been enabled by running the dhcp select relay command in the interface view.

Precautions

If you run the dhcp relay information enable command on an interface and the dhcp option82 { insert | rebuild } enable command in the VLAN view or on a physical interface in the VLAN simultaneously, only the dhcp relay information enable command takes effect.

Follow-up Tasks

Usage Scenario
This command applies to the DHCP relay agent. When DHCP Request messages carry Option 82 information, the DHCP server can locate user positions accurately and assign IP addresses to users using different policies. When a DHCP relay agent receives DHCP Request messages, it uses one of the following strategies to process Option 82 information:

    Drop:
        If the received DHCP message does not carry an Option 82 field, the DHCP relay agent forwards the message directly without processing it.
        If the received DHCP message carries an Option 82 field, the DHCP relay agent drops the Option 82 field and forwards the message.
    Keep:
        If the received DHCP message does not carry an Option 82 field, the DHCP relay agent forwards the message directly without processing it.
        If the received DHCP message carries an Option 82 field, the DHCP relay agent keeps the Option 82 field and forwards the message.
    Replace:
        If the received DHCP message does not carry an Option 82 field, the DHCP relay agent inserts an Option 82 field configured by the administrator into the received message and forwards the message.
        If the received DHCP message carries an Option 82 field, the DHCP relay agent replaces it with the Option 82 field configured by the administrator and forwards the message.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled by running the dhcp enable command in the system view.

DHCP relay has been enabled by running the dhcp select relay command in the interface view.

The Option 82 function has been enabled for the DHCP relay agent by using the dhcp relay information enable command.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

On a network with VXLAN distributed gateways as DHCP relay agents, to ensure that the DHCP OFFER messages from DHCP servers can arrive at the correct distributed gateways, you need to run the dhcp relay giaddr source-interface command on the distributed gateways to configure a source interface for relayed DHCP messages and fill the primary IP address of the source interface in the giaddr field. By default, DHCP servers select IP addresses from the address pool on the network segment specified in the giaddr field of their received DHCP DISCOVER messages. After the preceding command is run, since the primary IP address of the source interface is on a different network segment from that of the DHCP relay-enabled interface (which is the gateway for its downlink DHCP clients), if DHCP servers still select IP addresses from the address pool on the network segment specified in the giaddr field, DHCP clients cannot access the network after obtaining IP addresses.

To solve the preceding problem, run the dhcp relay information link-selection insert enable command to insert the Link-selection sub-option of the Option82 field into DHCP DISCOVER messages forwarded by the DHCP relay agent, and to fill in the IP address of the DHCP relay-enabled interface in the Link-selection sub-option. In this case, DHCP servers select IP addresses from the address pool on the network segment specified in the Link-selection sub-option of the Option 82 field of their received DHCP DISCOVER messages.

Prerequisites

DHCP relay has been enabled using the dhcp select relay command in the VBDIF interface view.

Precautions

    DHCP servers must be able to parse the Link-selection sub-option.

    After the dhcp relay information link-selection insert enable command is run, the Link-selection sub-option is added to DHCP messages, removing the need to configure policies for Option 82 insertion and processing. A DHCP relay agent processes the Link-selection sub-option in different ways depending on the policies for Option 82 insertion and processing:
        Without policies for Option 82 insertion and processing: The DHCP relay agent inserts the Option 82 field with the Link-selection sub-option into DHCP messages. When forwarding a DHCP message with the Option 82 field, the DHCP relay agent deletes the original Option 82 field and inserts the locally configured Option 82 field with the Link-selection sub-option.
        With policies for Option 82 insertion and processing: How the DHCP relay agent inserts the Link-selection sub-option into DHCP messages is determined by the configured policies. For example, if the Option 82 insertion mode is set to insert, the DHCP relay agent does not insert the Link-selection sub-option into DHCP messages when receiving DHCP messages carrying the Option 82 field.

    You can run the dhcp option82 { insert | rebuild } enable command to configure the Option 82 insertion mode, and run the dhcp relay information enable and dhcp relay information strategy { drop | keep | replace } commands to configure an Option 82 processing policy.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP relay agents. In some situations, for example, a user is forced to go offline, the user's IP address is no longer used. However, the user cannot access the network, and will not send a DHCP release message to the DHCP server to release the IP address assigned by the DHCP server. Before the IP address lease expires, the DHCP server will not assign the user's IP address to another client, wasting IP addresses. In this case, you can run the dhcp relay release command to configure a DHCP relay agent to send a DHCP release message to the DHCP server. After receiving the message, the DHCP server sets the status of the IP address to idle. The DHCP server then can assign the released IP address to another client.
If a DHCP server IP address is specified, the DHCP relay agent sends an address release request only to the specified DHCP server. If no DHCP server address is specified, the following situations occur:

    When the dhcp relay release command is run in the system view, the DHCP relay agent sends an address release request to DHCP servers on all the interfaces working in DHCP relay mode.
    When the dhcp relay release command is run in the interface view, the DHCP relay agent sends an address release request to all DHCP servers on the VLANIF interface.

Precautions

The dhcp relay release command only releases the IP addresses dynamically assigned by DHCP servers.

When multiple DHCP relay agents are connected between the DHCP client and server, this command must be executed on the first DHCP relay agent.
Example

# Configure a DHCP relay agent to send a release message to the DHCP server at 10.1.1.1 for releasing the IP address 192.168.1.1 assigned to the DHCP client whose MAC address is 00e0-fc34-2000.

dhcp relay request server-match enable

Function

The dhcp relay request server-match enable command configures a DHCP relay agent to check the DHCP server identifier (Option54) in a DHCP Request message to be forwarded.

The undo dhcp relay request server-match enable command configures a DHCP relay agent not to check the DHCP server identifier (Option54) in a DHCP Request message to be forwarded.

By default, a DHCP relay agent checks the DHCP server identifier (Option54) in a DHCP Request message to be forwarded.
Format

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

During the four-message exchange process, the DHCP Offer message sent by a DHCP server carries the DHCP server identifier (Option54) to identify the server. After receiving the DHCP Offer message, the DHCP client records the DHCP server identifier and carries it in the DHCP Request message to be replied to indicate which DHCP server is selected. When the DHCP relay agent forwards the DHCP Request message, it checks the DHCP server identifier in the message and forwards the message only to the corresponding DHCP server.

If multiple DHCP servers are deployed on the network and the design of a server does not comply with standards, the DHCP server identifier carried in the DHCP Offer message to be sent by the server is not its identifier. As a result, the DHCP server identifier carried in the DHCP Request message is incorrect, the DHCP relay agent forwards the message to an incorrect DHCP server rather than the matching DHCP server, and the client fails to obtain an IP address.

To resolve this issue, you can run the undo dhcp relay request server-match enable command, so that the DHCP relay agent does not check the DHCP server identifier (Option54) in the DHCP Request message to be forwarded and forwards the message to all relayed DHCP servers, ensuring that the matching DHCP server can receive the DHCP Request message.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled globally using the dhcp enable command.

Parameters

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

As defined in RFC2131, the DHCP server that provides only IP addresses for DHCP clients replies with DHCP ACK messages. After receiving a DHCP ACK message, a DHCP relay agent searches for the entry based on the DHCP client's MAC address contained in the message, forwards the message to the corresponding client, and then immediately deletes the entry matching the client.

If multiple DHCP servers are deployed on the network, the design of a server does not comply with standards, and a DHCP client requests for an IP address, the server does not provide an IP address for the DHCP client but replies with a DHCP ACK message. If the DHCP relay agent first receives the DHCP ACK message replied by the server, it incorrectly forwards the message to the client and deletes the corresponding entry. After the DHCP relay agent receives the correct DHCP ACK message, it cannot forward the message because the entry matching the client has been deleted. As a result, the client cannot obtain an IP address.

To resolve this issue, you can run the dhcp relay reply forward all enable command, so that the DHCP relay agent does not immediately delete the entry matching a client after forwarding a DHCP ACK message to the client. Instead, the DHCP relay agent deletes the entry that has been aged out to ensure that the subsequently received DHCP ACK messages can be forwarded to the client.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled globally using the dhcp enable command.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP relay agents. When a DHCP client needs to send a DHCP DISCOVER message to a DHCP server on a different network segment through a DHCP relay agent, you must configure the DHCP server IP address on the DHCP relay agent. If the DHCP server and DHCP client are not in the same VPN, you also need to specify the VPN where the DHCP server resides.
When a DHCP relay agent forwards a DHCP DISCOVER message, it does not check whether the DHCP server is Down. If multiple DHCP server addresses are configured on an interface, multiple DHCP servers respond with DHCP OFFER messages to the DHCP client. However, the DHCP client uses the first received DHCP OFFER message. As a result, IP addresses in the IP address pool on the first DHCP server are insufficient, but available IP addresses in the IP address pools on the other DHCP servers are not allocated. To make each DHCP server allocate the same number of IP addresses, a DHCP relay agent changes the forwarding order each time it forwards a DHCP DISCOVER message, so that load balancing is implemented among DHCP servers. A DHCP relay agent forwards a DHCP DISCOVER message as follows:

    The DHCP relay agent forwards the message to all DHCP servers by default, and changes the forwarding order each time it forwards a DHCP DISCOVER message.
    You can configure the ip relay address cycle command to reduce the number of messages received by a DHCP server and lessen the load of a DHCP server. After this command is configured, the DHCP relay agent forwards a received DHCP DISCOVER message to one DHCP server at a time, and forwards the DHCP DISCOVER message to a different DHCP server each time it receives the message.

Prerequisites

DHCP relay has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select relay command.

Precautions

To configure multiple DHCP server IP addresses, run this command for multiple times.

Each interface enabled with DHCP relay can be configured with a maximum of 20 DHCP server IP addresses.

If the interface enabled with DHCP relay is bound to a VPN instance but no VPN instance is specified for the DHCP server served by the DHCP relay agent, the DHCP relay agent sends packets through the VPN instance to which the interface belongs by default. If a VPN instance is specified for the DHCP server, the DHCP relay agent sends packets through the VPN instance specified for the DHCP server.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The dhcp relay server-select command applies to DHCP relay agents. When a DHCP client needs to send DHCP requests to a DHCP server using a DHCP relay agent, you can run the dhcp relay server-select command to specify a DHCP server group for the DHCP relay agent and configure the DHCP server address.

Prerequisites

    A DHCP server group has been created using the dhcp server group command.
    The DHCP relay function has been enabled using the dhcp select relay command so that the system can forward DHCP packets to the specified DHCP server.

Precautions

    Multiple interfaces can be configured with the same DHCP server group, and one interface can be configured with only one DHCP server group.
    If you run the dhcp relay server-select command in the same interface view for multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect. If a specified DHCP server group does not exist, the configuration fails; however, the latest configured DHCP server group still takes effect.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The dhcp select global command applies to DHCP servers. After receiving a DHCP Request message from a DHCP client, a DHCP server assigns an IP address from the local address pool to the client. Run the dhcp select global command to configure the device to assign IP addresses from the global address pool. When no interface address pool is created for the DHCP server, the DHCP server assigns an IP address from the global address pool to an online user.

The device can also assign IP addresses from an interface address pool using the dhcp select interface command in the interface view.
Prerequisites

    DHCP has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

Precautions

    When the device is configured as a DHCP server, if the server's real IP address is configured as the DHCP server IP address on a DHCP relay agent, the server's Layer 3 interface that receives relayed DHCP messages can process these messages, without the need of running the dhcp select global command on the interface.
    When the device is configured as a DHCP server, if the VRRP virtual IP address of the server's Layer 3 interface that does not receive DHCP messages is configured as the DHCP server IP address on the DHCP relay agent, the DHCP server cannot process messages relayed by the DHCP relay agent. The DHCP server can process messages relayed by the DHCP relay agent only if the VRRP virtual IP address of the server's Layer 3 interface that receives DHCP messages is configured as the DHCP server IP address on the DHCP relay agent and the dhcp select global command is configured on this Layer 3 interface.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The dhcp select relay command applies to DHCP relay agents. If the DHCP server and client are on the same network segment, they can directly communicate with each other using DHCP. In this case, no DHCP relay agent is needed. If the DHCP server and client are on different network segments, the DHCP relay function must be enabled to forward DHCP messages.

Prerequisites

The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

Follow-up Tasks

    To ensure that a DHCP relay agent can forward DHCP packets to a DHCP server, run the dhcp relay server-select or dhcp relay server-ip command on the DHCP relay-enabled interface to configure the correct IP address of the DHCP server.
    To ensure that a DHCP server can forward DHCP packets to a DHCP relay agent, you must configure a route to the DHCP relay agent on the DHCP server.

Precautions

    The DHCP server must select an IP address in the same network segment with the DHCP relay agent from the global address pool to ensure that the DHCP client obtains an IP address on the local network segment. No interface address pool can be configured on the interface that connects the DHCP server and relay agent.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

A DHCP server and a BOOTP server may reside on the same network segment. The BOOTP server assigns static IP addresses to BOOTP clients. As defined in the DHCP protocol, a DHCP server can also respond to BOOTP requests to assign IP addresses to BOOTP clients. BOOTP clients may obtain IP addresses from the DHCP server but not the BOOTP server.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled globally using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

Follow-up Procedure

Using the dhcp server bootp automatic command in the system view, you can enable the DHCP server to allocate IP addresses to BOOTP clients.
Example

# Enable a DHCP server to respond to a BOOTP request.

<HUAWEI> system-view

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. When BOOTP clients need to obtain their IP addresses, DNS server's IP address, and gateway IP address from a DHCP server, you need to run the dhcp server bootp automatic command to enable the DHCP server to dynamically allocate IP addresses to BOOTP clients.
Prerequisites

    DHCP has been enabled globally using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    The DHCP server has been enabled to respond to BOOTP requests by using the dhcp server bootp command, or dhcp server bootp automatic cannot take effect.

Precautions

When the device functions as the DHCP server, the device can allocate IP addresses to BOOTP clients if the BOOTP clients reside on the same network as the DHCP server. You can run the dhcp server bootp automatic command to dynamically allocate IP addresses. You can also run the static-bind command or the dhcp server static-bind command to allocate IP addresses to BOOTP clients in the static binding mode.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command is used on a DHCP server. When a DHCP server allocates IP addresses to clients, IP address conflict may occur because IP addresses of some hosts have been manually configured. In this case, the DHCP server considers these IP addresses as conflicting IP addresses, and allocates available IP addresses from the conflicting IP addresses to clients only after available IP addresses in the address pool are used up. To reclaim conflicting IP addresses promptly, the administrator can run this command to enable automatic reclaim and specify the reclaim interval.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When the device functions as a DHCP server, run the dhcp server database enable command to enable the device to save DHCP data to storage devices. This avoids data loss caused by device faults. Then the system generates lease.txt and conflict.txt files in the storage device. The two files save address lease information and address conflict information respectively. Run the display dhcp server database command to check the storage device for saving DHCP data. After the dhcp server database enable command is run, current DHCP data is automatically saved at the specified interval, and previous data files are overwritten. The interval can be set using the dhcp server database write-delay interval command.

If a fault occurs on the device, run the dhcp server database recover command to recover DHCP data from storage devices during the system restarts.

Prerequisites

The dhcp server database enable command has been run to enable the device to save DHCP data to storage devices, and ensure that the storage devices work properly.

Precautions

    The lease.txt and conflict.txt files are overwritten periodically; therefore, you are advised to back up and save the two files to other locations.
    The time displayed in the lease.txt and conflict.txt files is the UTC time rather than the system time, and you do not need to pay attention to time zone information.
    During the interval, if the device restarts unexpectedly, DHCP data generated at the interval is lost. Users can only recover the last successfully saved DHCP data from storage device files.

Example

# Enable the device to save the current DHCP data to storage devices and set the interval at which DHCP data is saved to 2000s.

<HUAWEI> system-view

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. If user hosts access hosts on the network through the domain name, user hosts need to send DNS Request messages to the DNS server and resolve the domain name. To enable DNS services on the DHCP client, specify the DNS server address for the interface address pool on the DHCP server. The DHCP server can assign both the specified DNS server address and an IP address to the client. To configure DNS server addresses for a global address pool, run the dns-list command.
Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.
    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Precautions

    Each address pool can be configured with a maximum of eight DNS server addresses. If multiple DNS server addresses are configured, the first DNS server address assigned to the DHCP client functions as the primary address and other addresses are secondary addresses.
    To specify multiple DNS servers, enter multiple DNS server addresses in the dhcp server dns-list command.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The dhcp server excluded-ip-address command applies to DHCP servers. Fixed IP addresses are allocated to some specific hosts (such as the WWW server) on the network for a long time. If these hosts' IP addresses are overlapped with IP addresses in the address pool and the DHCP server allocates these overlapped IP addresses to other hosts, IP address conflicts may occur. To prevent such IP address conflicts, you need to exclude these IP addresses from being automatically assigned in the address pool.

You can run the dhcp server excluded-ip-address command to specify the IP addresses or the range of IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned to clients in the interface address pool.

You can run the excluded-ip-address command to specify the IP addresses or the range of IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned to clients in the global address pool.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Precautions

    IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned must be in the address pool. If IP address range in the address pool is changed using the dhcp server ip-range command, IP addresses that are configured not to be automatically assigned must be within the new IP address range.

    You do not need to exclude the gateway address configured using the dhcp server gateway-list command from being automatically allocated. The device automatically adds the gateway address into the list of IP addresses that cannot be automatically allocated.

    You do not need to exclude the IP address of a server's interface connecting to a client from being automatically allocated. The device automatically sets the status of the interface IP address to Conflict during address assignment.
    If you run this command multiple times, you can specify multiple IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned to clients from the specified address pool.
    You can run the display ip pool command to check the IP addresses in use in the current address pool, so that you can exclude the unused IP addresses from being automatically assigned to clients. If you need to exclude IP addresses in Used and Conflict states from being automatically assigned to clients after address reclamation, you can also run the excluded-ip-address command. If an IP address has been bound to a specific MAC address, adding the IP address to the IP address list in which IP addresses are not automatically assigned to clients will unbind the IP address from the MAC address.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In general, when a DHCP client applies for an IP address from a DHCP server, parameters contained in the DHCP Request packet specify the options the client requires. The DHCP server inserts the required options to a DHCP Response packet.

Sometimes, a device, functioning as a DHCP server, receives a DHCP Request packet that contains no parameter specifying the options the client requires. However, the client still wants to obtain the options configured on the interface address pool. You can run the dhcp server force insert option code &<1-254> command to configure the DHCP server to forcibly insert an Option field to the DHCP Response packet.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Usage Guidelines

Scenario

When a DHCP client goes online in two steps, the IP address requested by the DHCP client is in the IP address pool, but no lease record of the DHCP client is found in the address pool. For example, after obtaining an IP address from another DHCP server, a wireless user roams to the current DHCP server and the original IP address is in the address pool of the current DHCP server. Alternatively, the address pool is reset and the original user needs to go online again. In this case, when receiving a DHCP Request message from the DHCP client, the DHCP server keeps silent and does not reply the DHCP client with a DHCP NAK message. The DHCP client can apply for an IP address to go online again in four steps only after the two steps for the client to go online time out. As a result, the DHCP client is slow in obtaining an IP address. To force the DHCP server to reply with a DHCP NAK message, you can run the dhcp server force response command, so that the DHCP client can quickly enter the four-step process for going online and apply for an IP address again.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled on the device using the dhcp enable command.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To load balance traffic and improve network reliability, you can configure multiple default gateway addresses.

The default gateway address allocated to the DHCP client can only be a class A, B, or C address, and cannot be a broadcast address, a host address, or a class A address whose network address is 0.

If the VRRP virtual IP address is configured on the interface and no gateway address is pre-allocated to the DHCP client using the dhcp server gateway-list command, the DHCP server uses the first VRRP virtual IP address as the gateway address to be allocated to the client. If no VRRP virtual IP address is configured on the interface, the DHCP server uses the physical IP address of the interface as the gateway address to be allocated to the client.

If the dhcp server gateway-list command is not configured, the gateway address allocated by the DHCP server to the DHCP client may fail to be displayed in trace information during fault diagnosis. Therefore, you are advised to configure this command if the DHCP server function based on an interface address pool is used.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. To meet different client requirements, DHCP supports dynamic, automatic, and static address assignment.
DHCP clients require different IP address leases.

    If a host (such as the DNS server) needs to use a fixed IP address for a long time, run the dhcp server lease unlimited command to configure the IP address lease as unlimited.
    If a host (such as a portable computer) needs to use a temporary IP address, run the dhcp server lease command to specify an IP address lease. After the lease expires, the DHCP server withdraws the IP address and assigns the address to other clients. In scenarios with high user mobility, new clients may fail to obtain IP addresses if allocated addresses are not reclaimed for a long time. As such, shortening the DHCP lease is recommended. For example, in Wi-Fi access scenarios of an airport or station, you can change the DHCP lease to 30 minutes.

When a DHCP client starts and 50% or 87.5% of its IP address lease has passed, the DHCP client sends a DHCP Request message to the DHCP server to renew the lease.

    If the IP address can still be assigned to the client, the DHCP server informs the client of a renewed IP address lease.
    If the IP address can no longer be assigned to the client, the DHCP server informs the client that the IP address lease cannot be renewed.

You can run the display ip pool command to view information about the IP address lease. The values of the lease and left fields in the command output indicate the configured lease time and remaining lease time, respectively.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Precautions

Different IP address leases can be specified for different interface address pools on a DHCP server. All IP addresses in an interface address pool have the same lease.

If the IP address lease of an address pool is changed using this command, newly assigned IP addresses use the new IP address lease. IP addresses assigned before the change still use the original IP address lease before the lease is updated, and use the new lease after the lease is updated.
Example
# Set the IP address lease of the address pool on VLANIF100 to 2 days 2 hours and 30 minutes.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] dhcp enable
[HUAWEI] interface vlanif 100

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command is used on a DHCP server. When the DHCP server allocates IP addresses to clients, it records address allocation information to facilitate routine maintenance and fault location. After the logging function during IP address allocation of the DHCP server is configured using the dhcp server logging command, the DHCP server records logs about address allocation, conflict, lease renewal, and release.

Run the display ip pool interface interface-pool-name command to check the status of the logging function during IP allocation of the DHCP server.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Precautions

    With this logging function enabled, if a large number of DHCP clients request IP addresses from the DHCP server, the server frequently records logs. The server performance may therefore be affected.
    IP address allocation logs are recorded in the AM module. To view log information, the information center must be enabled. In addition, default settings for log output vary depending on various factors including the log level and output direction. For details, see Information Center Configuration in the CLI-based Configuration - Device Management Configuration Guide.

    For example, the level of logs indicating that an IP address is successfully allocated, an IP address is successfully renewed, and an IP address is successfully released is informational, and these logs are not recorded in the log buffer by default. You can run the info-center source AM channel 4 log level informational command to change the level of the logs to be recorded in the log buffer. You can then run the display logbuffer command to check the preceding logs.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The dhcp server next-server command is used on DHCP servers. When assigning a DHCP client an IP address, a DHCP server can also assign the DHCP client an IP address of the server that provides network services for the client. For example, some clients like IP phones still need other configuration parameters after automatically obtaining IP addresses. You can run the dhcp server next-server command to specify the server address used after a client obtains an IP address. The client then requests the configuration parameters from the specified server after obtaining an IP address.

If users use addresses in the interface address pool, run the dhcp server next-server command to specify the DHCP server IP address. If users use addresses in the global address pool, run the next-server command to specify the DHCP server IP address.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Precautions

    The dhcp server next-server command takes effect for only users who use addresses in the interface address pool.
    If you run the dhcp server next-server command multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect.

Example
# Specify the server IP address 192.168.1.2 in the interface address pool on VLANIF100 used to provide services for terminal users.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. The Option field in a DHCP packet carries control information and parameters, including basic information such as the DNS service, NetBIOS service, and IP address lease. If a DHCP server is configured with option, when a DHCP client applies for an IP address from an interface address pool, the client can obtain configurations in the Option field of the DHCP response packet from the DHCP server without having to configure the DNS service, NetBIOS service, or IP address lease separately.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Precautions

    When the password is contained in option, the ascii or hex type is insecure. Set the option type to cipher. A secure password should contain at least two types of the following: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, number, and special characters. In addition, the password must consist of six or more than eight characters.
    The dhcp server option command configures basic functions, such as the NetBIOS service and IP address lease. The system also provides commands to configure these functions separately. These commands take precedence over the dhcp server option command.
    To set user-defined option for a global address pool, run the option command.

    When users on an enterprise's intranet use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, you need to configure proxy server parameters so that users can use browsers to access the network. The Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD) implements automatic configuration of these parameters. The administrator does not need to manually configure these parameters on each client. To implement the WPAD function, the administrator needs to deploy the configuration file of the proxy server in advance, and then run the dhcp server option 252 ascii ascii-string command to specify the URL of the configuration file. The ascii-string parameter specifies the URL of the configuration file, in the format of https://xxx/proxy.pac. Set ascii-string according to the actual location of the configuration file. When a browser accesses the network, the browser requests the DHCP server to send the URL of the configuration file on the proxy server, and then downloads the configuration file to conduct automatic configuration. After the configuration is completed, the browser can access the network.

    The value of ascii-string cannot be enclosed in double quotation marks as "ascii-string". Otherwise, terminals cannot parse Option252.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If a DHCP client sends a DHCP Discover message carrying a vendor ID to a DHCP server, the DHCP server needs to exchange the vendor information with the client using Option 125. You can run the dhcp server option 125 [ sub-option sub-code ] ascii ascii-string command to configure the vendor ID in Option 125 delivered by a DHCP server to a client. However, it is complex to convert the vendor ID into an ASCII character string.

To simplify the configuration, you can run the dhcp server option125 vendor-specific vendor-id command to specify the vendor ID in Option 125 of packets sent from a DHCP server to a client.

Prerequisites

    IP addresses have been configured in an interface address pool using the ip address command.
    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.
    Fields except Vendor-ID in Option 125 have been configured for the interface address pool using the dhcp server option 125 ascii ascii-string command. The Vendor-ID field in Option 125 occupies four bytes. Therefore, the ascii-string value is a string of 1 to 251 bytes.
    (Optional) The dhcp server force insert option 125 command has been used to configure the DHCP server to insert the Option 125 field specified for the interface address pool into the DHCP response packet sent from a DHCP server to a client. This resolves the problem in the following situation: The device functions as a DHCP server, and the DHCP request packet sent by a DHCP client does not carry Option 125. However, the DHCP client still expects the DHCP server to deliver Option 125 configured for the interface address pool.

Precautions

This command and the dhcp server option 125 sub-option sub-code ascii ascii-string are mutually exclusive on an interface.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. Repetitive IP address assignment will cause IP address conflicts. To solve this problem, before assigning an IP address to a client, the DHCP server needs to send ping packets using the dhcp server ping command to check whether the IP address is in use. Address detection checks whether the DHCP server receives any response within a certain period of time. If there is no response within a certain period of time, the DHCP server continues to send ping packets to this address until the number of ping packets reaches the maximum value. If there is still no response, it indicates that the IP address is not in use. This ensures that the IP address assigned to the client is unique.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled using the dhcp enable command.
Example

# Set the maximum number of ping packets to 3 and the maximum response time to 400 ms.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to the DHCP server. To enable DHCP clients to normally access the Internet, the DHCP server needs to specify the SIP server IP address in the interface address pool when assigning IP addresses to the clients.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Precautions

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The dhcp server static-bind command applies to DHCP servers. When planning a network, you need to allocate fixed IP addresses to some important hosts to ensure reliability. In this case, you can bind IP addresses in the address pool to the MAC addresses of these hosts. After the preceding configuration is complete, if the host of the MAC address to which the IP address is bound request an IP address from the DHCP server, the DHCP server finds the bound IP address based on the host's MAC address and allocates this IP address to the host, ensuring that the IP address obtained by the host is fixed.

You can run the dhcp server static-bind command to bind an IP address in an interface address pool to a MAC address.

You can run the static-bind command to bind an IP address in a global address pool to a MAC address.

Prerequisites

    The DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command in the system view.

    IP addresses in the interface address pool have been configured using the ip address command.

    The DHCP server function has been enabled on the interface using the dhcp select interface command.

Precautions

    Ensure that the bound IP address is not configured as the IP address that cannot be allocated using the dhcp server excluded-ip-address command.
    IP addresses that are used can also be statically bound to MAC addresses or unbound from MAC addresses. When an IP address is statically bound to a MAC address, ensure that the MAC address to be bound is the same as the MAC address of the user who actually uses the IP address.
    The DHCP server preferentially allocates the IP address that has been statically bound to the client's MAC address.
    After an IP address is bound to a MAC address, the IP address does not expire. After an automatically allocated IP address is statically bound to a MAC address, the lease time of the IP address becomes unlimited. After the static binding between the IP address and the MAC address is deleted, the lease time of the IP address becomes the same as that configured in the address pool.

Example

# Configure a DHCP server to assign a fixed IP address 10.10.10.20 in the interface address pool on vlanif 100 to a host with the MAC address 00e0-fcf3-2a3b.

Usage Scenario

The dhcp-server command applies to DHCP relay agents. To ensure that the DHCP relay agent can forward messages to multiple DHCP servers, configure multiple DHCP servers in a DHCP server group.

Precautions

    Each DHCP server group can be configured with a maximum of 20 DHCP servers. You can delete a DHCP server by specifying ip-address-index.
    If a VPN instance is bound to an interface, the DHCP server group must be bound to this VPN instance.

    If the interface enabled with DHCP relay is bound to a VPN instance but no VPN instance is specified for a DHCP server in a DHCP server group, the DHCP relay agent sends packets through the VPN instance to which the interface belongs by default. If a VPN instance is specified for a DHCP server in a DHCP server group, the DHCP relay agent sends packets through the VPN instance specified for the DHCP server.

Usage Scenario

The dhcp set ttl command is used on DHCP relay agents. When a DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP Discovery messages at Layer 3, it reduces the TTL value of the messages by 1 by default. Assume that the TTL value of a DHCP Discovery message received by the DHCP relay agent is 1. If the DHCP relay agent reduces the TTL value by 1, the TTL value changes to 0. The next-hop routing device will discard the message as its TTL value is 0. As a result, the DHCP server cannot receive the DHCP Discovery message forwarded by the DHCP relay agent. To ensure that the DHCP server can receive the DHCP Discovery message sent from the client, run the dhcp set ttl command to set the TTL value of the DHCP Discovery message to a non-zero value after the message is forwarded at Layer 3.
If the DHCP relay agent connects to a special client whose TTL value of DHCP Discovery messages is 1, and if there are routing devices between the DHCP relay agent and DHCP server, run the dhcp set ttl ttl-value command to specify a fixed TTL value (16 is recommended) for DHCP Discovery messages after they are forwarded by the DHCP relay agent at Layer 3.

Prerequisites

The DHCP function has been enabled globally using the dhcp enable command.
Example

# Set the TTL value of DHCP Discovery messages to 16 after the messages are forwarded by the DHCP relay agent at Layer 3.

dhcp speed-limit auto
Function

The dhcp speed-limit auto command enables dynamic rate limiting on DHCP packets.

The undo dhcp speed-limit auto command disables dynamic rate limiting on DHCP packets.

By default, dynamic rate limiting is disabled on DHCP packets.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To ensure security or facilitate management, users may require that the DHCP packet processing rate should be limited. If the rate is not limited, CPU and memory resources can be used up due to malicious attacks.
Table 6-16 and Table 6-17 list the mapping between the DHCP packet rate and CPU/memory usage after dynamic rate limiting on DHCP packets is enabled.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled globally by using the dhcp enable command.

Precautions

    When the CPU usage is higher than 70% or the memory usage is higher than 65%, the DHCP packet processing rate is limited.
    The DHCP packet processing rate is the same as the smaller rate among the rates corresponding to the CPU or memory usage. For example, when the CPU usage is 80% and the memory usage is 80%, the DHCP packet rate is 50.

Example

# Enable dynamic rate limiting on DHCP packets.

dhcp udp-checksum enable
Function

The dhcp udp-checksum enable command enables a device to add the UDP header checksum to DHCP packets to be sent.

The undo dhcp udp-checksum enable command disables a device from adding the UDP header checksum to DHCP packets to be sent.

By default, the UDP header checksum carried in DHCP packets sent by a device is 0, and the peer device does not verify the checksum.
Format

dhcp udp-checksum enable

undo dhcp udp-checksum enable
Parameters

None

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If the peer device does not comply with protocol standards, the peer device still verifies the UDP header checksum when the checksum carried in DHCP packets is 0. In this case, you can run the dhcp udp-checksum enable command to enable the device to add the UDP header checksum to DHCP packets to be sent.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled globally using the dhcp enable command.

Precautions

A device can add the UDP header checksum to DHCP packets to be sent only if the device functions as a DHCP server.
Example

# Enable a device to add the UDP header checksum to DHCP packets to be sent.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] dhcp udp-checksum enable

Rx buffers full or L2fdb lookup failed
	

Information displayed when the DHCP service is abnormal. The displayed information includes:

    Rx buffers full: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the remaining queue length is shorter than the reserved threshold.
    L2fdb lookup failed: Total number of DHCP ACK packets discarded because the DHCP snooping module fails to find user-side interfaces.
    High cpu occupancy: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the CPU usage is excessively high.
    Port blocked: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the inbound interface is blocked.
    Bad vlan id: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the interfaces receiving the DHCP packets are not added to the VLANs corresponding to the VLAN tags carried in the packets or the DHCP packets received on interfaces carry VLAN tags not in the range from 1 to 4094.
    Memory exhausted: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the memory is exhausted.
    L3if protocol down: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the Layer 3 protocol of the source interface goes Down.
    Rate limit: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because rates of the packets exceed the limit, when the dhcp snooping check dhcp-rate enable command is configured.
    Bad packet length: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the packet length is not in the range of 50 to 2048 bytes.
    Bad ip header length: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the IP header length is not in the range of 20 to 60 bytes

    Dest-port equals source: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the source interface is also the outbound interface.
    Bad chaddr: Total number of DHCP packets discarded due to incorrect client MAC addresses. A DHCP packet is discarded due to an incorrect client MAC address if a DHCP relay agent finds that the MAC address in the CHADDR field of the DHCP packet is not a unicast address, a DHCP snooping-enabled device finds that the MAC address in the CHADDR field of the DHCP request packet is different from the source MAC address, or the MAC address in the CHADDR field of the DHCP packet conflicts with the DHCP server MAC address.
    Bad giaddr: Total number of DHCP packets discarded due to incorrect values in the GIADDR field, when the dhcp snooping check dhcp-giaddr enable command is configured to check whether the GIADDR field in received DHCP packets is 0 or carries an invalid IP address, such as a loopback address.
    Bad request: Total number of invalid DHCP request packets that are discarded, when the dhcp snooping check dhcp-request enable command is configured to check the validity of DHCP packets.
    Bad reply: Total number of DHCP response packets discarded by untrusted interfaces configured with the dhcp snooping enable command.
    Bad dest udp-port: Total number of DHCP request packets discarded by the DHCP relay agent because the destination port number is UDP port 68.
    Bad message type: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because they are neither requests nor responses.
    Max-user limit: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the maximum number of users (configured by using the dhcp snooping max-user-number command) is exceeded.
    Add bindtable failed: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because dynamic binding entries are added. New dynamic binding entries may be added if the user-side interface is Down, or IPSG is configured but ACL resources are insufficient.
    Client transferred: Total number of DHCP packets discarded because the undo dhcp snooping user-transfer enable command is configured to disable location transition for DHCP snooping users.
    Other error: Total number of DHCP packets discarded due to other reasons.

Remaining lease of an IP address.

When the result of the calculation formula ([Lease – Left]/Lease) is 50% or 87.5%, the DHCP client sends a DHCP Request message to the DHCP server to renew the lease. If the renewal succeeds, the value of the Left field is recounted. If the renewal fails, the DHCP client requests an IP address again and the status of its original IP address is set to Expired.

Status (Second)
	

Status of an IP address:

    Used: indicates that the IP address is used.
    Idle: indicates that the IP address is idle.
    Expired: indicates that the lease of the IP address expires and the IP address is idle.
    Conflict(xxx): indicates that the IP address conflicts with another IP address on the network. xxx indicates the cause of the conflict. The possible values are as follows:
        Ping: A conflict is detected through ping packets.
        Decline: A terminal sends a DHCP Decline message to report a conflict.
        Auth: A conflict is detected during authentication.
    Disable: indicates that the IP address cannot be used.
    Static-bind: indicates that the IP address is bound to a MAC address.
    Static-bind used: indicates that the IP address is bound to a MAC address and used.

Views

IP address pool view, DHCP Option template view
Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. If user hosts access hosts on the network by domain names, user hosts need to send DNS requests to the DNS server and resolve the domain name to access for communication. To connect a DHCP client to the network, configure a DHCP server address so that the DHCP server can assign both the specified DNS server address and an IP address to the client. To configure DNS server addresses for an interface address pool, run the dhcp server dns-list command.

Precautions

In the IP address pool view and DHCP Option template view, a device can be configured with a maximum of eight DNS server addresses respectively. The address first assigned to the clients functions as the primary address, and the other seven addresses function as secondary addresses.
Example
# In the IP address pool view, set the IP address of the DNS server to 10.10.10.10.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ip pool global1
[HUAWEI-ip-pool-global1] dns-list 10.10.10.10

# In the DHCP Option template view, set the IP address of the DNS server to 10.10.10.10.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] dhcp option template template1
[HUAWEI-dhcp-option-template-template1] dns-list 10.10.10.10

domain-name
Function

The domain-name command configures the domain name suffix for DHCP clients.

The undo domain-name command deletes a configured domain name suffix.

By default, no domain name suffix is configured for DHCP clients.
Format

domain-name domain-name

undo domain-name
Parameters

Parameter
	

Description
	

Value

domain-name
	

Specifies a domain name to be assigned to a DHCP client.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 63 characters without spaces.
NOTE:

When quotation marks are used around the string, spaces are allowed in the string.
Views

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

This command applies to DHCP servers. When allocating an IP address to a client, a DHCP server can also assign a domain name suffix to the client. You can run the domain-name command on the DHCP server to specify the domain name suffix for clients. After this command is run, the DHCP server will send the domain name suffix to a client when allocating an IP addresses to the client.

To configure a domain name for an interface address pool, run the dhcp server domain-name (interface view) command.
Example
# In the IP address pool view, configure the domain name suffix assigned to the DHCP client as example.com.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ip pool test
[HUAWEI-ip-pool-test] domain-name example.com

# In the DHCP Option template, configure the domain name suffix assigned to the DHCP client as example.com.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] dhcp option template template1
[HUAWEI-dhcp-option-template-template1] domain-name example.com

excluded-ip-address
Function

The excluded-ip-address command specifies the range of IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned to clients from an address pool.

The undo excluded-ip-address command deletes the specified range of IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned to clients from an address pool.

By default, all IP addresses in an address pool can be automatically assigned to clients.
Format

excluded-ip-address start-ip-address [ end-ip-address ]

undo excluded-ip-address start-ip-address [ end-ip-address ]
Parameters

Parameter
	

Description
	

Value

start-ip-address
	

Specifies the start IP address of the IP address segment where addresses cannot be automatically assigned to clients.
	

The value is in dotted decimal notation.

end-ip-address
	

Specifies the end IP address of the IP address segment where addresses cannot be automatically assigned to clients. If end-ip-address is not specified, only the IP address corresponding to start-ip-address cannot be automatically assigned.
	

The value is in dotted decimal notation. end-ip-address and start-ip-address must be on the same network segment and end-ip-address must be larger than start-ip-address.

The excluded-ip-address command applies to DHCP servers. Fixed IP addresses are allocated to some specific hosts (such as the WWW server) on the network for a long time. If these hosts' IP addresses are overlapped with IP addresses in the address pool and the DHCP server allocates these overlapped IP addresses to other hosts, IP address conflicts may occur. To prevent such IP address conflicts, you need to exclude these IP addresses from being automatically assigned in the address pool.

You can run the excluded-ip-address command to specify the IP addresses or the range of IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned to clients in the global address pool.

You can run the dhcp server excluded-ip-address command to specify the IP addresses or the range of IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned to clients in the interface address pool.

Prerequisites

Network segment addresses that can be assigned from the global address pool have been configured using the network (IP address pool view) command.

Precautions

    The excluded IP address or IP address segment must be in the local address pool.

    You do not need to exclude the gateway address configured using the gateway-list command from being automatically allocated. The device automatically adds the gateway address into the list of IP addresses that cannot be automatically allocated.

    You do not need to exclude the IP address of a server's interface connecting to a client from being automatically allocated. The device automatically sets the status of the interface IP address to Conflict during address assignment.
    If you run the excluded-ip-address command multiple times, you can specify multiple IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses that cannot be automatically assigned to clients from the specified address pool.
    You can run the display ip pool command to check the IP addresses in use in the current address pool, so that you can exclude the unused IP addresses from being automatically assigned to clients. If you need to exclude IP addresses in Used and Conflict states from being automatically assigned to clients after address reclamation, you can also run the excluded-ip-address command. If an IP address has been bound to a specific MAC address, adding the IP address to the IP address list in which IP addresses are not automatically assigned to clients will unbind the IP address from the MAC address.

Example

# Disable IP addresses 10.10.10.10 to 10.10.10.20 from being automatically assigned to clients from the address pool global1.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ip pool global1

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When a DHCP client applies for an IP address from a DHCP server, parameters contained in the DHCP Request packet specify the options the client requires. The DHCP server inserts the required options to a DHCP Response packet.

Sometimes, the DHCP server on the existing network receives a DHCP Request packet that contains no parameter specifying the options the client requires. However, the client still wants to obtain the options configured on the global address pool. You can run the force insert option code &<1-254> command to configure the DHCP server to forcibly insert an Option field to the DHCP Response packet.

Prerequisites

The Option field has been configured in the global address pool by running the option code [ sub-option sub-code ] { ascii ascii-string | hex hex-string | cipher cipher-string | ip-address ip-address &<1-8> } command in the global address pool view.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP relay agents. If a DHCP server and its DHCP relay agent are on different network segments, you can run the gateway command to specify an egress gateway address for the DHCP relay agent. In this way, the DHCP relay agent can communicate with the DHCP server. Run the gateway-list command to configure an egress gateway for the DHCP server.

Precautions

    If an egress gateway is not configured for a DHCP relay agent using the gateway command, the DHCP relay agent uses the VLANIF interface address as the gateway address to communicate with the DHCP server.
    When two switch devices function as the DHCP server and DHCP relay agent respectively, they must use the same egress gateway address.

Example

# Specify the egress gateway address of the server group myServers as 10.10.10.1.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] dhcp server group myServers
[HUAWEI-dhcp-server-group-myServers] gateway 10.10.10.1

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. If a DHCP server and its client are on different network segments, you can run the gateway-list command to specify an egress gateway address. In this way, the DHCP server and client can communicate with each other. Then the DHCP server can assign both an IP address and the specified egress gateway address to the client. You can configure multiple gateways in a global address pool to load balance traffic and improve network reliability.

To configure an egress gateway for a DHCP relay agent, run the gateway (DHCP server group view) command.

Configuration Impact

If a gateway address is configured on the DHCP server, a DHCP client will obtain the gateway address from the DHCP server and automatically generates a default route to the gateway address. If you run the option121 command on the DHCP server to allocate classless static routes to DHCP clients, the DHCP client uses an allocated classless static route and does not automatically generate a default route to the gateway address.

Precautions

    The IP addresses specified in the excluded-ip-address command cannot be configured as a gateway address.
    After an IP address is configured as a gateway address, the device adds the IP address to the list of IP addresses that cannot be automatically allocated, removing the need to run the excluded-ip-address command.
    In the IP address pool view or DHCP Option template view, a maximum of eight egress gateway addresses can be configured on the device. These gateway addresses cannot be subnet broadcast addresses.
    When configuring an egress gateway address for the global address pool of a DHCP server, ensure that this egress gateway address is the same as that of the DHCP relay agent.

Example

# In the IP address pool view, set the egress gateway address for the DHCP client to 10.1.1.1.

<HUAWEI> system-view

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

DHCP is developed based on the BOOTP protocol. The device supports both DHCP and BOOTP and allows hosts to obtain IP addresses by BOOTP.
To enable an interface to obtain IP addresses using BOOTP, you can enable the BOOTP client function on the interface. A BOOTP client requests for an IP address from the server using BOOTP. The BOOTP client has two functions:

    Sends BOOTP Request messages to the server.
    Processes BOOTP Reply messages from the server.

To obtain an IP address, the BOOTP client sends a BOOTP Request message to the server. When the server receives the BOOTP Request message, it sends a BOOTP response message to the BOOTP client. The BOOTP client obtains the assigned IP address from the response message.

Precautions

Interfaces of the Switch can have IP addresses statically configured using the ip address command or dynamically obtain IP addresses using the ip address bootp-alloc command. A static IP address takes precedence over a dynamic IP address. If the interface has dynamically obtained an IP address after the ip address bootp-alloc command is executed, running the undo ip address command deletes the IP address and the ip address bootp-alloc command. If the interface does not obtain an IP address after the ip address bootp-alloc command is executed, running the undo ip address command does not delete the ip address bootp-alloc command.
Example

# Enable the BOOTP client function on VLANIF100 to obtain an IP address.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] interface vlanif 100
[HUAWEI-Vlanif100] ip address bootp-alloc

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario
To enable an interface on the Switch to obtain an IP address using DHCP, enable the DHCP client function on the interface. A DHCP client applies for an IP address from the server using DHCP. The DHCP client has two functions:

    Sends DHCPREQUEST messages to the server.
    Processes DHCPACK messages from the server.

To obtain an IP address, the DHCP client sends a DHCPREQUEST message to the server. After the server receives the DHCPREQUEST message, it sends a DHCPACK message to the DHCP client. The DHCP client obtains the assigned IP address from the DHCPACK message.

Precautions

Interfaces of the device can have IP addresses statically configured using the ip address command or dynamically obtain IP addresses using the ip address dhcp-alloc command. A static IP address takes precedence over a dynamic IP address. If the interface has dynamically obtained an IP address after the ip address dhcp-alloc command is executed, running the undo ip address command deletes the IP address and the ip address dhcp-alloc command configuration. If no IP address is obtained through the ip address dhcp-alloc command, running the undo ip address command does not delete the ip address dhcp-alloc command configuration.

For the S1720GW-E and S1720GWR-E, if no IP address is configured on the device, VLANIF 1 uses the IP address 192.168.1.253 255.255.255.0 by default, and the ip address dhcp-alloc unicast command is configured on the interface by default. After VLANIF 1 obtains an IP address through DHCP successfully, the IP address 192.168.1.253 255.255.255.0 is deleted. If the DHCP client function is enabled on another VLANIF interface, the VLANIF interface cannot obtain the IP address in the same network segment as that of VLANIF 1, which prevents address conflict.
Example

# Enable the DHCP client function on VLANIF100 to obtain an IP address.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] interface vlanif 100
[HUAWEI-Vlanif100] ip address dhcp-alloc

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. When configuring a DHCP server, run the ip pool command in the system view to create a global IP address pool and set parameters for the global IP address pool, including a gateway address, the IP address lease, and a VPN instance. Then the configured DHCP server can assign IP addresses in the IP address pool to clients.

Precautions

A maximum of 128 address pools, including global address pools and interface address pools, can be created on the device.

Follow-up Procedure

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP relay agents. When multiple DHCP server addresses are configured on a DHCP relay agent, the DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP Discover messages to all servers by default. As a result, DHCP servers need to process a large number of messages, leading to heavy loads of servers. To solve this problem, configure the ip relay address cycle command. After this command is configured, the DHCP relay agent forwards a received DHCP Discover message to one DHCP server at a time, and forwards the DHCP Discover message to a different DHCP server each time it receives the message. Multiple DHCP servers then can allocate the same number of IP addresses, implementing load balancing among DHCP servers.

Prerequisites

DHCP has been enabled globally using the dhcp enable command.

Precautions

After the ip relay address cycle command is run, the DHCP relay agent forwards a received DHCP Discover message to a different DHCP server each time in the sequence in which DHCP servers were configured. You can run the display dhcp relay command to view DHCP server IP addresses in the Server IP address field to determine the sequence in which DHCP servers were configured.

IP address pool view
Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. To meet different client requirements, DHCP supports dynamic, automatic, and static address assignment.

Different hosts require different IP address leases. For example, if some hosts such as a DNS server need to use certain IP addresses for a long time, run the lease command to set the IP address lease of the current global address pool to unlimited. If some hosts such as a portable computer just need to use temporary IP addresses, run the lease command to set the IP address lease of the current global address pool to the required time so that the expired IP addresses can be released and assigned to other clients.

When a DHCP client starts and 50% or 87.5% of its IP address lease has passed, the DHCP client sends a DHCP Request message to the DHCP server to renew the lease.

    If the IP address can be assigned to the client, the DHCP server informs the client that the IP address lease can be renewed.
    If the IP address can no longer be assigned to the client, the DHCP server informs the client that the IP address lease cannot be renewed. The client needs to request for another IP address.

You can run the display ip pool command to view information about the IP address lease. The values of the lease and left fields in the command output indicate the configured lease time and remaining lease time, respectively.

Prerequisites

A global IP address pool has been created using the ip pool command.

Precautions

Different IP address leases can be specified for different global address pools on a DHCP server. In a global address pool, all addresses have the same lease.

To specify the IP address lease for an interface address pool, run the dhcp server lease command.

If the IP address lease of an address pool is changed using this command, newly assigned IP addresses use the new IP address lease. IP addresses assigned before the change still use the original IP address lease before the lease is updated, and use the new lease after the lease is updated.
Example

# Set the lease of a global address pool global1 to 2 days 2 hours and 30 minutes.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ip pool global1
[HUAWEI-ip-pool-global1] lease day 2 hour 2 minute 30

Usage Guidelines

After the lock command is run, the specified IP address pool is locked and IP addresses in this address pool cannot be assigned to clients. When a DHCP server needs to be redeployed, you need to migrate address pools on the DHCP server to another DHCP server on the live network. To retain the addresses that have been assigned to clients from a global address pool, run the lock command to lock the global address pool. When new users get online after the address pool migration, they apply for IP addresses from a new address pool.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command is used on a DHCP server. When the DHCP server allocates IP addresses to clients, it records address allocation information to facilitate routine maintenance and fault location. After the logging function during IP address allocation of the DHCP server is configured using the logging command, the DHCP server records logs about address allocation, conflict, lease renewal, and release.

Run the display ip pool name ip-pool-name command to check the status of the logging function during IP address allocation of the DHCP server.

Prerequisites

The global address pool has been created using the ip pool (system view) command.

Precautions

    With this logging function enabled, if a large number of DHCP clients request IP addresses from the DHCP server, the server frequently records logs. The server performance may therefore be affected.
    IP address allocation logs are recorded in the AM module. To view log information, the information center must be enabled. In addition, default settings for log output vary depending on various factors including the log level and output direction. For details, see Information Center Configuration in the CLI-based Configuration - Device Management Configuration Guide.

    For example, the level of logs indicating that an IP address is successfully allocated, an IP address is successfully renewed, and an IP address is successfully released is informational, and these logs are not recorded in the log buffer by default. You can run the info-center source AM channel 4 log level informational command to change the level of the logs to be recorded in the log buffer. You can then run the display logbuffer command to check the preceding logs.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. Before a DHCP server assigns IP addresses to clients from a global address pool, run the network command to set a network segment address for the global address pool so that the DHCP server can select and assign IP addresses on this network segment to clients. When a DHCP server assigns an IP address to the client from the interface address pool, the network segment of the interface IP address is that of the interface address pool.

Precautions

    Each IP address pool can be configured with only one network segment. If the system needs multiple address segments, multiple IP address pools are required.
    The size of an address pool can be controlled by setting the mask length. The mask length is in reverse proportion to the address pool size.
    When configuring an address pool, ensure that IP addresses on the network address segment must be class A, B, or C IP addresses, and the mask cannot be set to 0 to 7, 31, or 32.
    If you need to assign IP addresses with a 16-bit mask in the network segment 10.1.1.0 to clients, the number of IP addresses in an IP address pool is 64K after the network 10.1.1.0 mask 16 command is executed in the view of the IP address pool. If the number of IP addresses in the IP address pool is less than 64K, the network 10.1.1.0 mask 16 command cannot be executed in the view of the IP address pool. In this case, perform the following operations:

    Run the following commands in the IP address pool view:

    [HUAWEI-ip-pool-test] ip pool test  
    [HUAWEI-ip-pool-test] section 0 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.254  // The section command specifies the range of IP addresses to be allocated.
    [HUAWEI-ip-pool-test] network 10.1.1.1 mask 16  // The network command specifies the mask of IP addresses to be allocated using the mask parameter.

    Enable the DHCP server function on a specific interface.

    [HUAWEI-Vlanif10] ip address 10.1.1.1 16
    [HUAWEI-Vlanif10] dhcp select global

    The size of the IP address pool cannot be larger than 16K.

Example

# Set the network segment address of the IP address pool global1 to 192.168.1.0 and mask length to 24.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ip pool global1
[HUAWEI-ip-pool-global1] network 192.168.1.0 mask 24

next-server
Function

The next-server command configures the IP address of a server for the DHCP client after the client automatically obtains the IP address.

The undo next-server command deletes a configured IP address of a server for the DHCP client after the client automatically obtains the IP address.

By default, no IP address of a server is configured for the DHCP client after the client automatically obtains the IP address.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The next-server command is used on DHCP servers. When assigning a client an IP address, a DHCP server can also assign the client an IP address of the server that provides network services for the client. For example, after obtaining IP addresses, clients such as IP phones need parameters such as the startup configuration file to work normally. You can run the next-server command to specify the server address used after a client obtains an IP address. The client then requests the configuration parameters from the specified server after obtaining an IP address.

If users use addresses in the interface address pool, run the dhcp server next-server command to specify the DHCP server IP address. If users use addresses in the global address pool, run the next-server command to specify the DHCP server IP address.

Precautions

    Only one IP address of a server that provides network services can be configured in each IP address pool view or DHCP Option template view. If the system needs multiple IP addresses of servers that provide network services, configure multiple IP address pools or DHCP Option templates.
    If you run the next-server command multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. The option field in a DHCP packet carries control information and parameters. If a DHCP server is configured with options, when a DHCP client applies for an IP address, the client can obtain the configurations in the option field of the DHCP response packet from the DHCP server. To configure user-defined options for an interface address pool, run the dhcp server option command.

Precautions

    To ensure configuration accuracy, read the Request For Comments (RFC) before configuring options.

    When an option contains a password, the option code of the ascii or hex type is insecure. You are advised to set the option code type to cipher. For security purposes, a password must contain at least two types of the following: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. In addition, the password must consist of at least eight characters.
    Note the following if the option code [ sub-option sub-code ] { ascii ascii-string | hex hex-string | cipher cipher-string | ip-address ip-address &<1-8> } command is not executed for the first time:
        If the new code is different from the existing code, both the new and existing configurations take effect.
        If the new code is the same as the existing code, the following situations may occur:
            When a sub-code is specified in the existing command, the new configuration overrides the existing configuration if the new and existing sub-codes are the same, and both the new and existing configurations take effect if the new and existing sub-codes are different. If no sub-code is specified in the new command, the new configuration overrides the existing configuration.
            When no sub-code is specified in the existing command, the new configuration overrides the existing configuration.
    If the device functions as the DHCP server to assign IP addresses to APs, and the AC and APs are on different network segments, you need to configure the Option 43 field to specify the AC IP address for the APs. Otherwise, the APs cannot discover the AC. Run the option 43 { hex hex-string | [ sub-option 1 hex hex-string | sub-option 2 ip-address ip-address &<1-8> | sub-option 3 ascii ascii-string ] } command to configure the device to specify the AC IP address for APs in one of the following methods:
        Run the option 43 hex 031D3139322e3136382e3139342e35302c3139322e3136382e3139342e3534 command to configure the device to specify AC IP addresses 192.168.194.50 and 192.168.194.54 for APs. In this command, 03 indicates that the sub-option value of Option43 is an ASCII value; 1D indicates that the length of IP addresses (192.168.194.50,192.168.194.54) including dots (.) and the comma (,) is 29, and multiple IP addresses are separated by the comma (,); 3139322e3136382e3139342e3530 indicates the ASCII value of 192.168.194.50; 2C indicates the ASCII value of the comma (,); 3139322e3136382e3139342e3534 indicates the ASCII value of 192.168.194.54.
        Run the option 43 sub-option 1 hex C0A80001C0A80002 command to configure the device to specify AC IP addresses 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 for APs. In the command, C0A80001 indicates the hexadecimal format of 192.168.0.1, and C0A80002 indicates the hexadecimal format of 192.168.0.2.
        Run the option 43 sub-option 2 ip-address 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2 command to configure the device to specify AC IP addresses 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 for APs.
        Run the option 43 sub-option 3 ascii 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 command to configure the device to specify AC IP addresses 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 for APs.

        If you need to configure multiple IP addresses when the option is specified as an ASCII character string, use commas (,) to separate the IP addresses.
    If the AC and APs are on the same network segment, you do not need to configure the Option 43 field, and the APs can discover the AC in broadcast mode. After Option 43 is configured, the APs unicast Discover Request packets to the IP address carried in Option 43 to discover the AC. If the APs do not receive any Discovery Response packet after sending unicast Discovery Request packets, the APs then broadcast packets to discover the AC.

    When users on an enterprise's intranet use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, you need to configure proxy server parameters so that users can use browsers to access the network. The Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD) implements automatic configuration of these parameters. The administrator does not need to manually configure these parameters on each client. To implement the WPAD function, the administrator needs to deploy the configuration file of the proxy server in advance, and then run the option 252 ascii ascii-string command to specify the URL of the configuration file. The ascii-string parameter specifies the URL of the configuration file, in the format of https://xxx/proxy.pac. Set ascii-string according to the storage path of the configuration file. When a browser accesses the network, the browser requests the DHCP server to send the URL of the configuration file on the proxy server, and then downloads the configuration file to conduct automatic configuration. After the configuration is completed, the browser can access the network.

    The value of ascii-string cannot be enclosed in double quotation marks as "ascii-string". Otherwise, terminals cannot parse Option252.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If a DHCP client sends a DHCP Discover message carrying a vendor ID to a DHCP server, the DHCP server needs to exchange the vendor information with the client using Option 125. You can run the option 125 [ sub-option sub-code ] ascii ascii-string command to configure the vendor ID in Option 125 delivered by a DHCP server to a client. However, it is complex to convert the vendor ID into an ASCII character string.

To simplify the configuration, you can run the option125 vendor-specific vendor-id command to specify the vendor ID in Option 125 of packets sent from a DHCP server to a client.

Prerequisites

    A global address pool has been created using the ip pool command in the system view, and the IP address pool view is displayed.
    Fields except Vendor-ID in Option 125 have been configured for the global address pool using the option 125 ascii ascii-string command. The Vendor-ID field in Option 125 occupies four bytes. Therefore, the ascii-string value is a string of 1 to 251 bytes.
    (Optional) The force insert option 125 command has been used to configure the DHCP server to insert the Option 125 field specified for the global address pool into the DHCP response packet sent from a DHCP server to a client. This resolves the problem in the following situation: The device functions as a DHCP server, and the DHCP request packet sent by a DHCP client does not carry Option 125. However, the DHCP client still expects the DHCP server to deliver Option 125 configured for the global address pool.

Precautions

This command and the option 125 sub-option sub-code ascii ascii-string command are mutually exclusive in an IP address pool.
Example
# Configure the VLAN and vendor information in Option 125 in the IP address pool view.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to the DHCP server. To enable DHCP clients to normally access the Internet, the DHCP server needs to specify the SIP server IP address in the address pool when assigning IP addresses to the clients.

Precautions

    A maximum of two SIP server addresses can be configured in each address pool. The first assigned address functions as the primary address, and the other address functions as a secondary address.
    Before specifying the IP address or name for a SIP server, ensure that the SIP server exists.
    If you run this command repeatedly, the latest configuration overrides the previous ones.

Example

# Specify 192.168.1.1 as the IP address of the SIP server when addresses in the global address pool global1 are assigned to clients.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ip pool global1 
[HUAWEI-ip-pool-global1] sip-server ip-address 192.168.1.1

sname
Function

The sname command configures the name of the server from which the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file.

The undo sname command deletes the configured name of the server from which the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file.

By default, no name is configured for the server from which the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file.
Format

sname sname

undo sname
Parameters

Parameter
	

Description
	

Value

sname
	

Specifies the name of the server where the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 63 case-sensitive characters without spaces. When double quotation marks are used around the string, spaces are allowed in the string.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Besides assigning IP addresses, a DHCP server can also provide the required network configuration parameters, such as the startup configuration file name for the DHCP client. After the name of the server from which the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file is configured using the sname command, the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file from this server.

Precautions

Ensure that the route between the DHCP client and the file server from which the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file is reachable.
Example
# In the IP address pool view, configure the name of the server from which the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file as example.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ip pool p1
[HUAWEI-ip-pool-p1] sname example

# In the DHCP Option template view, configure the name of the server from which the DHCP client obtains the startup configuration file as example.

static-bind
Function

The static-bind command binds an IP address in a global address pool to a MAC address of a client.

The undo static-bind command unbinds the IP address in a global address pool from a MAC address.

By default, the IP address in a global address pool is not bound to any MAC address.
Format

static-bind ip-address ip-address mac-address mac-address [ option-template template-name | description description ]

undo static-bind [ ip-address ip-address | mac-address mac-address ]
Parameters

Parameter
	

Description
	

Value

ip-address ip-address
	

Specifies the IP address to be bound. The IP address must be a valid IP address in the global address pool.
	

The value is in dotted decimal notation.

mac-address mac-address
	

Specifies the user MAC address.
	

The value is in H-H-H format. An H is a hexadecimal number of 1 to 4 digits.

option-template template-name
	

Specifies the name of the DHCP Option template. To allocate network configuration parameters except IP addresses to static clients, specify the parameter. Before specifying the parameter, run the dhcp option template command to create a DHCP option template, and configure network parameters for static clients in the DHCP Option template view.
	

The name is a string of 1 to 31 case-sensitive characters without spaces.

description description
	

Specifies the user description.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 256 case-sensitive characters. It can contain spaces.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The static-bind command applies to DHCP servers. When planning a network, you need to allocate fixed IP addresses to some important hosts to ensure reliability. In this case, you can bind IP addresses in the address pool to the MAC addresses of these hosts. After the preceding configuration is complete, if the host of the MAC address to which the IP address is bound request an IP address from the DHCP server, the DHCP server finds the bound IP address based on the host's MAC address and allocates this IP address to the host, ensuring that the IP address obtained by the host is fixed.

You can run the static-bind command to bind an IP address in a global address pool to a MAC address.

You can run the dhcp server static-bind command to bind an IP address in an interface address pool to a MAC address.

Prerequisites

Network segment addresses that can be assigned from the global address pool have been configured using the network (IP address pool view) command.

Precautions

    Ensure that the bound IP address is not configured as the IP address that cannot be allocated using the excluded-ip-address command.
    IP addresses that are used can also be statically bound to MAC addresses or unbound from MAC addresses. When an IP address is statically bound to a MAC address, ensure that the MAC address to be bound is the same as the MAC address of the user who actually uses the IP address.
    The DHCP server preferentially allocates the IP address that has been statically bound to the client's MAC address.
    After an IP address is bound to a MAC address, the IP address does not expire. After an automatically allocated IP address is statically bound to a MAC address, the lease time of the IP address becomes unlimited. After the static binding between the IP address and the MAC address is deleted, the lease time of the IP address becomes the same as that configured in the address pool.

Example

# Configure a DHCP server to assign a fixed IP address 192.168.1.10 in the global address pool global1 to a host with the MAC address 00e0-fc96-e4c0.

<HUAWEI> system-view

vpn-instance (global address pool view)
Function

The vpn-instance command binds an IP address pool to a VPN instance.

The undo vpn-instance command restores the default setting.

By default, an IP address pool is not bound to any VPN instance.
Format

vpn-instance vpn-instance-name

undo vpn-instance
Parameters

Parameter
	

Description
	

Value

vpn-instance-name
	

Specifies the name of a VPN instance.
	

The value must be an existing VPN instance name.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

This command applies to DHCP servers. To apply DHCP services in a VPN instance, you need to run the vpn-instance command to bind the created IP address pool to the VPN instance.

Prerequisites

A VPN instance has been created using the ip vpn-instance command.

Precautions

    The VPN instance bound to the IP address pool on the DHCP server must be the same as the VPN instance bound to the DHCP server group on the DHCP relay agent; otherwise, users in the IP address pool cannot go online using this DHCP server group.
    If an IP address pool is bound to a VPN instance, IP addresses assigned from this address pool are VPN addresses.
    To bind an interface address pool to a VPN instance, run the ip binding vpn-instance command in the interface view.

Example

# Bind the address pool global1 to the VPN instance example.
