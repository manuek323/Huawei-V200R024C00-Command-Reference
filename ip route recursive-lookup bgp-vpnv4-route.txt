ip route recursive-lookup bgp-vpnv4-route
Function

The ip route recursive-lookup bgp-vpnv4-route enable command enables a device to recurse static routes to cross routes on the remote VPN.

The ip route recursive-lookup bgp-vpnv4-route disable command disables a device from recursing static routes to cross routes on the remote VPN.

The undo ip route recursive-lookup bgp-vpnv4-route disable command enables a device to recurse static routes to cross routes on the remote VPN.

By default, a static route can recurse to a cross route on the remote VPN.

Only the S5731-H, S5731S-H, S5731-S, S5731S-S, S6730-S, S6730S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730S-H, and S6730-H support this command.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Recursion is required if next hops of static routes are not directly reachable. You can run the ip route recursive-lookup bgp-vpnv4-route enable command to enable the device to recurse a static route to a cross route on the remote VPN. The static route can then inherit the Label and Token information about the cross route. The device can forward data through the tunnel to which the static route recurses.

Precautions

The ip route recursive-lookup bgp-vpnv4-route enable command and the undo ip route recursive-lookup bgp-vpnv4-route disable command have the same function and do not generate configurations in the configuration file.

This command allows IPv4 static routes to recurse to cross routes on the remote VPN, not applicable to IPv6 static routes.
