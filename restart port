Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If an interface on an RU is faulty, you can run this command to restart the interface.

Precautions

    If an interface is disabled (in the shutdown state) before the restart, the interface is enabled automatically (in the undo shutdown state) after the restart.
    An RU that has no interconnection interface bound cannot be restarted.

Example

# Restart interface 1 on the RU.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
[HUAWEI-remote-unit-0] restart port 1
