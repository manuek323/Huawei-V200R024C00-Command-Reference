Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To view the status of Layer 2 links connecting the central switch and RUs for analyzing the network topology, you need to run this command to enable XLDP.

Configuration Impact

After XLDP is enabled globally, the device sends its own status information to XLDP-enabled neighbors and receives the status information from the neighbors.

Precautions

After global XLDP is disabled, the XLDP configuration is deleted from all interfaces.
XLDP can be enabled in the system view and the interface view.

    After XLDP is enabled in the system view, all interfaces are enabled with XLDP.
    After XLDP is disabled in the system view, all XLDP settings are restored to the default settings except the setting of XLDP trap. Therefore, XLDP is also disabled on all interfaces.
    An interface can send and receive XLDP packets only after XLDP is enabled in both the system view and the interface view.
    After XLDP is disabled globally, the commands for enabling and disabling XLDP on an interface do not take effect.

Example

# Enable XLDP globally.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] xldp enable

# Disable XLDP globally.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] xldp disable
