Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If IGP, static, and blackhole routes exist on a network and a link fault occurs, services may be interrupted because static routes may recurse to blackhole routes and remain active. To ensure uninterrupted services, run the ip route recursive-lookup blackhole protocol static disable command. This command will prevent static routes from recursing to blackhole routes so that static routes will become inactive and IGP routes will be selected.

Precautions

The ip route recursive-lookup blackhole protocol static enable and undo ip route recursive-lookup blackhole protocol static disable commands have the same function. You only need to run one of them.
