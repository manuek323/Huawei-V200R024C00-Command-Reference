Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

After an RU is delivered, its downlink interfaces are in the same broadcast domain and are not isolated by default. This allows users connected to the same RU to communicate with each other before being authenticated. To prevent this, you can configure interface isolation on RUs. To isolate downlink interfaces on all RUs, run the isolate enable command in the remote-unit view.

Follow-up Procedure

After running this command, run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.
Example

# Configure interface isolation on all RUs.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit 
[HUAWEI-remote-unit] isolate enable
