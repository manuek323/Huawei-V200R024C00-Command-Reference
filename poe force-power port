Usage Scenario

If the system power is sufficient, you can run this command to enable forcible power supply on RU interfaces connected to non-standard PDs when the RU, as the PSE, cannot detect the PDs.

Precautions

This command forcibly increases the power supplied by the RU. Ensure that the total power of PDs connected to the RU does not exceed the RU's available power.

Follow-up procedure

After running this command, run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.
