Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

    You can run this command to reset a faulty RU.
    If an RU fails to be upgraded and enters the cooldown period, you can run the reboot command to end the cooldown period.

Precautions

    An RU that has no interconnection interface bound cannot be reset.
    An RU that fails to be authenticated or is not authenticated cannot be reset.
    An RU that encounters a communication error will fail to be reset.
    RUs do not save their configurations. After an RU starts, it goes online on the central switch. After the RU is authenticated successfully, the central switch delivers configurations to the RU for them to take effect. For example, port isolation is required on an RU. After you restart the RU, its downlink interfaces can communicate with each other. The interfaces are isolated after the central switch authenticates the RU successfully and delivers the port isolation configuration.
