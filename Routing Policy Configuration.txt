10.1 Overview of Routing Policies
Definition
Routing policy is a policy that controls routes using a series of tools or methods.
This type of policy will affect route generation, advertisement, and selection and
so affect the packet forwarding path. These tools include ACL, route-policy, ip-
prefix, and filter-policy, and these methods include filtering routes and setting
attributes for routes.
Purpose
On an IP network, routing policy is mainly used to filter routing information and
modify route attributes. Table 10-1 describes its functions.

Using routing policy to filter routing information
Figure 10-1 Using routing policy to filter routing information
In Figure 10-1, SwitchA is dual-homed to SwitchB and SwitchC and will receive
routes from both SwitchB and SwitchC. If SwitchA wants to receive routes only
from SwitchB but not from SwitchC, configure routing policy on SwitchA to permit
the routes received from SwitchB and deny the routes received from SwitchC.

Figure 10-2 Using routing policy to modify route attributes
In Figure 10-2, SwitchA is also dual-homed to SwitchB and SwitchC. Because
SwitchB has better link stability and higher bandwidth than SwitchC, links of
SwitchB and SwitchC need to function as the primary and backup links
respectively. When the primary link fails, traffic is automatically switched to the
backup link. To meet this requirement, you can use routing policy to set a lower
route cost on SwitchB and set a higher route cost on SwitchC. Subsequently, traffic
is automatically transmitted over the primary link of SwitchB, and the link of
SwitchC functions as the backup link for route backup.
Benefits
Routing policies offer the following benefits:
● Improves network security by controlling route receiving, advertising and
importing.
● Improves network performance by modifying route attributes for proper
traffic planning.

The ACL, IP prefix list, AS_Path filter, community filter, extcommunity filter, and RD
filter can be used only to filter routes but not modify attributes of filtered routes.
A route-policy is a comprehensive filter, and it can use the matching rules of the
ACL, IP prefix list, AS_Path filter, community filter, extcommunity filter, and RD
filter to filter routes. In addition, attributes of filtered routes can be modified using
the route-policy. The following describes these filters.
ACL
An ACL is a set of sequential filtering rules. Users can define rules based on packet
information, such as inbound interfaces, source or destination IP addresses,
protocol types, and source or destination port numbers, and specify an action to
deny or permit packets. After an ACL is configured, the system classifies received
packets based on the rules defined in the ACL and denies or permits the packets
accordingly.
An ACL only classifies packets based on defined rules and can be used to filter
packets only when it is applied to a routing policy.
ACLs can be configured for both IPv4 packets and IPv6 packets. Users can specify
the IP address and subnet address range in an ACL to match the source IP address,
destination network segment address, or next-hop address of a route.
IP Prefix List
An IP prefix list contains a group of route filtering rules. Users can specify the
prefix and mask length range to match the destination network segment address

or next-hop address of a route. An IP prefix list is used to filter routes that are
advertised and received by dynamic routing protocols.
An IP prefix list is easier to configure and more flexible than an ACL. However, if a
large number of routes with different prefixes need to be filtered, it is complex to
configure an IP prefix list to filter these routes.
IP prefix lists can be configured for both IPv4 routes and IPv6 routes, and these IP
prefix lists share the same implementation process. An IP prefix list filters routes
based on the mask length or mask length range.
● Mask length: An IP prefix list filters routes based on IP address prefixes. An IP
address prefix is defined by an IP address and a mask length. For example, for
the route to 10.1.1.1/16, the mask length is 16 bits, and the valid prefix is 16
bits (10.1.0.0).
● Mask length range: If routes have the same IP address prefix but different
masks, the prefix mask length range can be specified for exact match or for
matching routes within the specified mask length range.
NOTE
0.0.0.0 is a wildcard address. If the IP prefix is 0.0.0.0, either a mask or a mask length range
can be specified following the prefix:
● If a mask is specified, all routes with this mask are permitted or denied.
● If a mask length range is specified, all routes with the mask length in this range are
permitted or denied.
AS_Path Filter
An AS_Path filter is used to filter BGP routes based on AS_Path attributes
contained in BGP routes. The AS_Path attribute records numbers of all ASs that a
BGP route passes through from the local end to the destination in the distance-
vector (DV) order. Therefore, filtering rules defined based on AS_Path attributes
can be used to filter BGP routes. The matching condition of an AS_Path filter is
specified using a regular expression. For example, ^30 indicates that only the
AS_Path attribute starting with 30 is matched.
For details about AS_Path filter principles and applications, see 10.2.5 AS_Path
Filter Applications in BGP.
Community Filter
A community filter is used to filter BGP routes based on Community attributes
contained in BGP routes. The Community attribute is a set of destination
addresses with the same characteristics. Therefore, filtering rules defined based on
Community attributes can be used to filter BGP routes.
In addition to well-known Community attributes, users can define community
attributes using digits. The matching condition of a community filter can be
specified using a community ID or regular expression.
For details about community filter principles and applications, see 10.2.6
Community Attribute Applications in BGP.

Extcommunity Filter
An extcommunity filter is used to filter BGP routes based on extended community
attributes. BGP extended community attributes are classified into two types:
● VPN target: A VPN target controls route learning between VPN instances,
isolating routes of VPN instances. A VPN target may be either an import or
export VPN target. Before advertising a Virtual Private Network version 4
(VPNv4) or Virtual Private Network version 6 (VPNv6) route to a remote
Multi-protocol Extensions for Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) peer, a PE
adds an export VPN target to the route. After receiving a VPNv4 or VPNv6
route, the remote MP-BGP peer compares the received export VPN target with
the local import VPN target to determine which routes can be added to the
routing table of the local VPN instance.
● Site-of-Origin (SoO): If multiple CEs at a VPN site are connected to different
PEs, the routes advertised from the CEs to the PEs may be re-advertised to
this VPN site after the routes have traversed the backbone network. This may
cause routing loops within the VPN site. To prevent routing loops, you can
configure an SoO attribute to differentiate routes advertised from different
VPN sites.
RD Filter
An RD filter is used to filter BGP routes based on RDs in VPN routes. RDs are used
to distinguish IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes in the same address segment in VPN
instances. RD filters specify matching rules regarding RD attributes.
Route-Policy
A route-policy is a complex filter. It is used to match attributes of specified routes
and change route attributes when specific conditions are met. A route-policy can
use the preceding six filters to define its matching rules.
Invoking Between Tools in Routing Policy
In applications, to control routes, tools used in routing policy must be used
together. Figure 10-3 shows invoking between these tools.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 10 Routing Policy Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 950
Figure 10-3 Invoking between tools in routing policy
InFigure 10-3, all the tools used in routing policy are classified into the following
types:
● Conditional tool: captures required routes.
● Policy tool: performs an action on the captured routes, for example, permit,
deny, and modify attributes.
● Invoking tool: applies a routing policy to a specific routing protocol to make
the routing policy to take effect.
NOTE
Among the invoking tools, filter-policy and peer have the policy tool function, so they can
directly invoke conditional tools. Other invoking tools must invoke conditional tools through
route-policy.
The invoking tool, peer, can invoke all conditional tools except ACL.

Filtering Rules
An IP prefix list can contain multiple index entries, each of which corresponds to a
filtering rule. In Figure 10-4, the system matches routes against entries in
ascending order of index number.
● If a route matches a permit entry, this route is permitted. If a route matches a
deny entry, this route is denied.
● If a route does not match any entry in the IP prefix list, this route is denied.
Figure 10-4 Matching principles of an IP prefix list
Route filtering rules of an IP prefix list include: sequential match, unique match,
and deny by default.
● Sequential match: Routes are matched against entries in ascending order of
index number. If different index numbers are configured for multiple entries in
the same IP prefix list, different filtering results may be obtained. Therefore,
exercise caution when configuring index numbers.
● Unique match: If a route matches one entry, it no longer tries to match other
entries.
● Deny by default: By default, all the routes that do not match any entry are
denied. Therefore, after one or multiple deny entries are created in an IP
prefix list, one entry needs to be created to permit all the other routes.

Mask Matching
One advantage of IP prefix list over ACL is that routes can be matched against
their mask. The following example shows the ip ip-prefix command used to
configure an IPv4 prefix list:
ip ip-prefix
ip-prefix-name [ index
index-number ] { permit | deny }
ipv4-address
mask-length [ greater-equal
greater-equal-value ] [ less-equal
less-equal-value ]
In this command,
ipv4-address mask-length [ greater-equal
greater-equal-value ]
[ less-equal
less-equal-value ] defines the network ID and mask range of routes
to be filtered. Table 10-3 describes parameters in this command.
Table 10-3 An address range in an IP prefix list
Parameter Description
ipv4-address Specifies a network ID.
mask-length Specifies the mask length for exact match.
greater-equal
greater-equal-value
Indicates that the mask length must be greater than or
equal to
greater-equal-value.
less-equal
less-
equal-value
Indicates that the mask length must be less than or
equal to
less-equal-value.
When a route to be filtered has matched a network ID, the mask length can be
matched exactly or within a specified mask length.
● If both greater-equal and less-equal are not configured in the command,
exact match is performed on routes. That is, only the routes with the specified
mask-length are matched.
● If only greater-equal is configured in the command, the mask length range
used for matching routes is [
greater-equal-value, 32].
● If only less-equal is configured in the command, the mask length range used
for matching routes is [
mask-length,
less-equal-value].
● If both greater-equal and less-equal are configured in the command, the
mask length range used for matching routes is [
greater-equal-value,
less-
equal-value].
Differences Between IP Prefix List and ACL
Both IP prefix list and ACL can be used to filter routes. ACLs can match only the
network ID but not the mask (prefix length), but an IP prefix list is more flexible
than ACLs because it can match both the network ID and mask, improving route
matching accuracy.
The following two examples can help differentiate ACL and IP prefix list.

Figure 10-5 Using an IP prefix list to filter imported routes
In Figure 10-5, SwitchB has two static routes, but only the static route
192.168.0.0/16 needs to be imported into OSPF.
Check the IP routing table of SwitchB. The following command output shows that
it has two static routes 192.168.0.0/16 and 192.168.0.0/24. Now only the route
192.168.0.0/16 needs to be re-advertised into OSPF.

First, use an ACL to meet this requirement.
1. 1. Configure a basic ACL 2001.
[SwitchB] acl 2001
[SwitchB-acl-basic-2001] rule permit source 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255

2. Configure node 10 in the route-policy RP to permit the route matching the

[SwitchB] route-policy RP permit node 10

3. Import the static route permitted by the route-policy RP into OSPF.

The command output shows that the two routes to 192.168.0.0 have been
imported. This is because in the ACL 2001 rule permit source 192.168.0.0
0.0.255.255, 0.0.255.255 indicates a wildcard but not the mask length.
After a wildcard is converted into a binary number, 0 indicates that routes need to
match this ACL, while 1 indicates that routes do not. For example, 192.168.0.0
0.0.255.255 specifies a route prefix range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. The two
routes 192.168.0.0/16 and 192.168.0.0/24 both match the ACL 2001. Therefore, the
two routes match node 10 in the route-policy RP and both are imported into
OSPF. ACLs cannot ensure that only the route 192.168.0.0/16 or 192.168.0.0/24 is
matched because ACLs can match only network ID but not mask.
The following uses an IP prefix list to filter the imported routes. Check
whether an IP prefix list can ensure that only the route 192.168.0.0/16 is
imported and the route 192.168.0.0/24 is filtered out.
1. Configure an IP prefix list huawei and configure node 10 to permit the route
192.168.0.0/16.
[SwitchB] ip ip-prefix huawei index 10 permit 192.168.0.0 16
2. Configure a route-policy RP and configure node 10 to permit the route that
matches the IP prefix list huawei and deny all the unmatched routes.
[SwitchB] route-policy RP permit node 10
[SwitchB-route-policy] if-match ip-prefix huawei
[SwitchB-route-policy] quit
3. Import the static route permitted by the route-policy RP into OSPF.
[SwitchB] ospf
[SwitchB-ospf-1] import-route static route-policy RP
[SwitchB-ospf-1] quit
4. After the preceding configurations are complete, check the IP routing table of

10.2.3 Route-Policy Implementation and Applications
Components
A route-policy is a complicated filter, which can match route attributes and change
route attributes when conditions are met.
In Figure 10-6, a route-policy consists of node ID, matching mode, if-match clause
(condition statement), and apply clause (action statement).
Figure 10-6 Components of a route-policy
● Node ID
A route-policy can contain multiple nodes. Routes must follow the following
rules when matching a route-policy:
– Sequential match: The system checks routing entries against nodes in
ascending order of node ID. Therefore, you need to specify node IDs in
the required sequence.
– Unique match: The relationship between all nodes in a route-policy is
"OR". This means that if a route matches one node in a route-policy, the
route matches this route-policy and does not need to match the other
nodes in this route-policy.
● Matching mode
Two node matching modes are available: permit and deny.
– permit: If a route matches a node, the actions defined by the apply
clauses of this node are performed on this route, and the system does not
match this route against the next node. If a route does not match a node,
the system matches this route against the next node.
– deny: If a route matches all the if-match clauses of a node, this route is
denied by this node, the system does not match this route against the
next node, and the actions defined by the apply clauses of this node will
not be performed on this route. If a route does not match the if-match
clauses of a node, the system matches this route against the next node.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 10 Routing Policy Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 956
NOTE
A route-policy in permit mode that does not contain if-match and apply clauses is
often set behind multiple deny nodes to allow all other routes to pass through.
● if-match clause (condition statement)
if-match clauses define matching conditions. Each node in a route-policy can
contain multiple or no if-match clauses. If a permit node does not contain any
if-match clause, this node matches all routes.
● apply clause (action statement)
apply clauses define actions. When routes are filtered against a route-policy,
the system sets attributes for the routes according to the actions defined by
apply clauses. Each node in a route-policy can contain multiple or no apply
clauses. If you only need to filter routes but do not need to set attributes for
routes, apply clauses do not need to be used.
Matching Rules
The matching rules of each node in a route-policy depend on the following
factors:
● Matching mode of the node in the route-policy: permit or deny
● Matching conditions (permit or deny) defined by if-match clauses (for
example, IP prefix list or ACL) of the node
The following table describes possible matching results for each node.

routes against the next node of this
route-policy.
● The system matches the routes that do

node against the next node of this
route-policy.
NOTE
On the switch, all unmatched routes are denied by the route-policy by default. If more than
one node is defined in a route-policy, at least one node must be in permit mode. The
reason is as follows:
● If a route fails to match any node, the route is denied by the route-policy.
● If all the nodes in the route-policy are set in deny mode, all the routes to be filtered are
denied by the route-policy.
Among the preceding four combinations, the first two combinations are easy to
understand and commonly used. The last two combinations are a little difficult to
understand, and the following example describes the third combination for your
reference.
Assume that the matching condition of if-match clauses in a node is deny and the
matching condition of this node is permit. The configuration is as follows:
#
acl number 2001
rule 5 deny source 172.16.16.0 0 //Deny 172.16.16.0
#
acl number 2002
rule 5 permit source 172.16.16.0 0 //Permit 172.16.16.0
#
route-policy RP permit node 10 //In this node, the route 172.16.16.0 is denied and the system matches
it against the next node.

Distance-vector routing protocols (such as RIP) and link-state routing protocols
(such as OSPF) vary in principles. Therefore, filter-policy filtering rules vary
between the two types of routing protocols. The following table lists differences in
routing information transmission between distance-vector routing protocols and
link-state routing protocols.

vector routing protocols and link-state routing protocols

Route Transmission Principles
Distance-vector
routing protocols
Routing devices transmit routing information. This routing
information is like roadmap for packets. The devices guide
packet forwarding based on the roadmap.

Routing Protocol
Type
Route Transmission Principles
Link-state routing
protocols
Routing devices transmit link state advertisements (LSAs).
A link state database (LSDB) is a set of LSAs and describes
the entire network topology, which is like a map. The
devices find the optimal forwarding path for packets based
on the map and shortest path algorithm.
Filter-policy in distance-vector routing protocols
Figure 10-8 Filter-policy in distance-vector routing protocols
In Figure 10-8, when using distance-vector routing protocols, devices transmit
routing information. To filter the routing information, use a filter-policy. Figure
10-8 shows where a filter-policy takes effect in the inbound and outbound
directions. To filter the routing information transmitted from an upstream device
to a downstream device, you only need to configure filter-policy export on the
upstream device or configure filter-policy import on the downstream device.

In Figure 10-9, when using link-state routing protocols, routing devices transmit
LSAs and then calculate their routing tables based on the LSDB. The following
uses OSPF as an example to describe filter-policy filtering rules:
● The filter-policy import command filters the routes calculated by OSPF but
not the LSAs advertised and received.
● The filter-policy export command filters the imported routes to be advertised
so that only eligible external routes are translated into Type 5 LSAs (AS-
external-LSAs) and advertised. In this manner, imported external routes can
be filtered as required to prevent routing loops.
Using a Filter-Policy to Filter the Routes Advertised by RIP
Requirement Description
In Figure 10-10, three switches exchange routes through RIP. Three static routes
(used as test routes) are imported into the RIP process of SwitchA. It is required
that the filter-policy export command be configured on SwitchB to filter the
routes advertised to SwitchC, that is, deny the route 192.168.3.0/24 and permit
other routes.

[SwitchB] ip ip-prefix huawei index 20 permit 0.0.0.0 0 less-equal 32 //Permit all routes.
2. Configure the filter-policy export command in the RIP view of SwitchB.

however, SwitchC cannot learn the route 192.168.3.0/24 through RIP because this
route has been filtered out before being advertised by SwitchB.

The preceding command output shows that after the filter-policy import
command is configured on SwitchB, the IP routing tables of SwitchB and SwitchC
do not contain the route 192.168.3.0/24.
RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol and a RIP device advertises its routing
table to its neighbors. When the route 192.168.3.0/24 is filtered out from the IP
routing table of SwitchB, SwitchC can no longer learn this route through RIP. That
is, if routes in an IP routing table of a RIP device are filtered, the IP routing tables
of upstream devices of this RIP device are also affected.
NOTE
Both the filter-policy export and filter-policy import commands are configured in the RIP
process view. If routes are filtered based on interfaces or protocols, only one filter-policy can
be configured for one interface or protocol. If no interface or protocol is specified, a global
filter-policy is configured and similarly, only one filter-policy can be configured. If multiple
filter-policies are configured, only the latest filter-policy takes effect.

The preceding command output shows that, although the route 10.1.1.0/24 has
been filtered out on SwitchB, its LSA is still transmitted to SwitchC, so the IP
routing table of SwitchC still contains this route. This result also confirms that in
link-state routing protocols, a filter-policy filters only routing information but not
LSAs.
The LSDBs of SwitchB and SwitchC still contain the LSA describing the route
10.1.1.0/24. To verify this, check LSA information on SwitchB and SwitchC.

Type 3 LSA generated by SwitchB, but this route has been filtered out by SwitchB.
Therefore, the Type 3 LSA describing an inter-area route cannot be generated, and
SwitchC cannot learn the route 10.1.1.0/24 again.

10.2.5 AS_Path Filter Applications in BGP
Overview
The AS_Path attribute is an ordered list of all the ASs that a route passes through
from the source to the destination. In Figure 10-14, the AS_Path attribute of a
BGP route can be considered as a string containing spaces and can be used to
match routes through a regular expression.
Figure 10-14 AS_Path attributes of BGP routes
A regular expression is a string that describes a characteristic and verifies whether
another string conforms to this characteristic. The AS_Path filter of BGP defines an
AS_Path regular expression to match AS_Path attributes of BGP routes for filtering
BGP routing information.
For example, ip as-path-filter 1 permit 495 defines an AS_Path filter 1 and a
regular expression 495, indicating that any string containing 495 can be matched.
AS_Path Regular Expressions
The core of an AS_Path filter is a regular expression. The content of a regular
expression is complex. The following describes the AS_Path filter.
An AS_Path filter uses a regular expression to define matching rules. A regular
expression consists of the following parts:
● Metacharacter: defines matching rules.
● General character: defines matching objects.
Table 10-6 lists metacharacters supported by BGP AS_Path regular expressions.

[2-4] matches 2, 3, and 4, and [0-9]
matches numbers 0 to 9.
NOTE
The characters in the brackets "[ ]" can only be
numbers 0 to 9. To match AS_Paths within the
range of 735 to 907, use (73[5-9]|7[4-9][0-9]|
8[0-9][0-9]|90[0-7]).
[^a-
z]
Matches AS_Paths
without any character
within the range
specified in the brackets
"[ ]".
[^2-4] matches AS_Paths without 2, 3, or 4,
and [^0-9] matches AS_Paths without
numbers 0 to 9.
_ Matches AS_Paths with a
sign, such as a comma
",", left brace "{", right
brace "}", left
parenthesis "(", right
parenthesis ")", or space.
The underscore "_" can
be used at the beginning
of a regular expression
with the same function
as the caret "^" or at the
end of a regular
expression with the same
function as the dollar
sign "$".
● ^65001_ matches AS_Paths that begin
with 65001 followed by a sign.
Specifically, ^65001_ matches AS_Paths
with 65001 as the leftmost AS number
(the number of the last AS through which
a route passes) or the routes sent by
peers in AS 65001.
● _65001_ matches AS_Paths with 65001 or
matches routes that pass through AS
65001.
● _65001$ matches AS_Paths that end with
a sign followed by 65001. Specifically,
_65001$ matches AS_Paths with 65001 as
the rightmost AS number (the number of
the first AS through which a route
passes) or matches the routes that are
originated in AS 65001.

Description Example
\ Indicates an escape
character.
A backslash "\" is used to disable special
functions of signs in regular expressions,
such as the left parenthesis "(" and right
parenthesis ")" in an AS_Confed_Sequence,
the left bracket "[" and right bracket "]" in
an AS_Confed_Set, and the left brace "{" and
right brace "}" in an AS_Set.
● \(65002_ matches AS_Confed_Sequences
that begin with (65002 followed by a
sign. Specifically, \(65002_ matches
AS_Confed_Sequences with 65002 as the
leftmost AS number (the number of the
last AS through which a route passes) or
matches the routes sent by peers in AS
65002.
● \(.*_65003_.*\) matches
AS_Confed_Sequences with 65003 or
matches the routes that pass through AS
65003.
● _65004\) matches AS_Confed_Sequences
that end with a sign followed by 65004).
Specifically, _65004\) matches
AS_Confed_Sequences with 65004 as the
rightmost AS number (the number of the
first AS through which a route passes) or
matches the routes that are originated in
AS 65004. _65004\) and 65004\) have the
same function.
Multiple rules (permit or deny) can be specified in an AS_Path filter. The
relationship between theses rules is "OR", which means that if a route meets one
of the matching rules, the route matches the AS_Path filter. The following
demonstrates the functions of AS_Path filters in different scenarios.
Applications
The AS_Path filter defines only a filtering tool, which takes effect only after being
invoked. Two methods are available in BGP to invoke the AS_Path filter:
● Use the peer command.
● Use a route-policy.
Method 1: Invoke the AS_Path filter using the peer command.
#
ip as-path-filter s1 permit ^100$
#

Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 10 Routing Policy Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 971
peer 10.1.1.2 as-path-filter s1 import
#
In method 1, an AS_Path filter s1 is defined and associated with a regular
expression ^100$. This AS_Path filter can match routes carrying the AS_Path
attribute 100 (this attribute contains only the AS number 100) and is applied in
the peer command. In this situation, only the routes that match AS_Path filter s1
can be advertised to the BGP peer 10.1.1.2.
Method 2: Invoke the AS_Path filter using a route-policy.
#
ip as-path-filter s1 permit ^100$
#
route-policy huawei permit node 10
if-match as-path-filter s1
apply local-preference 100
#
bgp 65100
peer 10.1.1.2 route-policy huawei import
#
In method 2, a defined AS_Path filter s1 is invoked in the if-match command in a
route-policy, and then the Local-Preference attribute is set using the apply
command and applied in the peer command (in the import direction) in BGP
configuration mode. In this situation, among the BGP routes received from the
BGP peer 10.1.1.2, all the routes that match the AS_Path filter s1 have their LP
path attributes set to 100.
AS_Path Filter Examples
In Figure 10-15, an EBGP peer relationship is established between LSW1 and
LSW2, between LSW1 and LSW3, between LSW2 and LSW3, between LSW2 and
LSW4, between LSW3 and LSW4, and between LSW4 and LSW5. Each device uses
the network command to advertise IP addresses of LoopBack0 into BGP and filter
these routes.

10.2.6 Community Attribute Applications in BGP
Community Attribute
The Community attribute is a set of destination addresses with the same
characteristics. It simplifies routing policy applications and facilitates routing policy
management and maintenance and allows a group of BGP devices in multiple ASs
to share the same routing policies. This attribute is a route attribute and
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 10 Routing Policy Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 975
transmitted between BGP peers and not restricted within an AS. Before advertising
a route with the Community attribute to peers, a BGP device can change the
original Community attribute of this route.
● The Community attribute is a set of 4-byte values, in the format AA:NN. As
defined in RFC1997, the first two bytes indicate an AS number, and the last
two bytes indicate a community identifier used for management.
● The Community attribute is a BGP route tag that simplifies the
implementation of routing policy. A specific Community attribute can be
assigned to some routes. Based on this Community attribute, these routes can
be managed and routing policy can be performed on these routes.
Figure 10-16 Community attribute application
In Figure 10-16, a large number of routes in AS100 are imported into BGP, and
these routes are used for voice calls and video surveillance. These routes are
advertised to AS200 through BGP. Devices in AS200 need to carry out different
policies on the routes used for voice calls and video surveillance. How to match
these routes? You can use ACLs or IP prefix lists to match the routes one by one.
This method, however, has a heavy workload and is inefficient because a large
number of route prefixes exist.
You can use the Community attribute to address this issue. When these routes are
imported into AS100, respective Community attributes are added to the routes to
differentiate the routes used for voice calls and video surveillance. That is, the
Community attribute 100:1 is added to the routes used for voice calls, and the
Community attribute 100:2 is added to the routes used for video surveillance.
These Community attributes are transmitted to AS200 along with the routes. In
AS200, to carry out different policies for the routes used for voice calls and video
surveillance, match the routes based on their respective Community attributes. For
example, you can match all the routes used for voice calls based on the
Community attribute 100:1.
BGP defines some well-known Community attributes. Table 10-7 lists these
Community attributes.

Setting the Community Attribute for Routes
To use the Community filter, ensure that the Community attribute is carried in
routes. The following describes how to set the Community attribute for routes.
Figure 10-17 Setting the Community attribute for routes
Requirement Description
In Figure 10-17, LSW1 in AS100 advertises two routes 10.1.1.0/24 and 10.1.2.0/24
through BGP. In the BGP process of LSW1, use an export route-policy to modify
the Community attribute of the route 10.1.1.0/24 to 100:1 so that downstream
devices can carry out policies on the route based on this Community attribute.
Configuration
The key configuration of LSW1 is as follows:
#
ip ip-prefix huawei index 10 permit 10.1.1.0 24 //Define an IP prefix list to match the target route.
#
route-policy RP permit node 10 //Define a route-policy to set the Community attribute for the

By default, the Community attribute is not updated to BGP peers along with the
route prefix. Therefore, the peer advertise-community command needs to be
configured on LSW1 and LSW2 to advertise this attribute to BGP peers.
Verification
After the preceding configurations are complete, check the BGP route 10.1.1.0 in
the BGP routing table of LSW3.

Using a Community Filter to Match BGP Routes
The previous section describes how to set the Community attribute for BGP routes.
After this attribute is set on an upstream router, it is transmitted along with routes
so that downstream devices can carry out policies based on this attribute. BGP
provides a tool, Community filter, to match BGP routes based on the Community
attribute. The following describes how to use a Community filter to match BGP
routes.
Figure 10-18 Using a Community filter to match BGP routes
Requirement Description
In Figure 10-18, LSW1 in AS100 advertises three BGP routes. The Community
attribute is set for the routes and transmitted along with the routes to LSW3 in

LSW3, and other BGP routes are denied.
For this scenario, the following provides three common methods to configure the
Community filter:
Case 1:
ip community-filter 1 permit 100:1 100:999
//Only the routes that carry two Community attributes 100:1 and 100:999 can be matched. Therefore, the
route 10.1.1.0/24 is matched.

10.3 Summary of Routing Policy Configuration Tasks
Table 10-9 describes the routing policy configuration tasks. After routing policies
are configured, apply them only when using routing protocols to advertise, receive,
or import routes to implement the route filtering and attribute configuration
functions.
Table 10-9 Routing policy configuration tasks
Scenario Description Task
Configuring the filter Routing policy filters
include: ACLs, IP prefix lists,
AS path filters, community
filters, extended community
filters, and RD filters. These
routing policy filters can be
applied to the if-match
clauses of a routing policy
and can also be used
separately in specific
situations.
10.5 Configuring
Filters
Configuring routing
policies
To reduce network burden
and ensure network
security, apply the routing
policies with if-match
clauses in the following
situations:
● Importing routes
● Advertising and receiving
routes
● Filtering using the RT
and RD attributes in the
VPN

Scenario Description Task
Configuring filter-policies If you need to control
receiving and advertisement
of routes in each routing
protocol, use filter-policies:
● filter-policy import
allows receiving only the
routes that meet filtering
criteria.
● filter-policy export
allows advertising only
the routes that meet
filtering criteria.

Scenario Description Task
Configuring the valid
time of a routing policy
In practical applications,
when multiple cooperative
configurations of a routing
policy change, the routing
management (RM) module
immediately informs the
protocols to re-apply the
routing policy after a
configuration is complete. If
routing policies are
incomplete, route flapping
occurs, which results in
network instability.
The processing rules for
routing policy changes are
as follows:
● By default, if a routing
policy changes, the RM
module immediately
informs the protocols to
apply a new routing
policy.
● If the valid time of a
routing policy is
configured, the RM
module does not
immediately inform the
protocols to process the
changes when the
related command
configurations of the
routing policy change.
Instead, routing protocols
wait for the configured
valid time and then apply
a new routing policy.
● If the configuration of
the routing policy
changes again during the
configured valid time, the
RM module resets the
timer.
To configure the valid time,
run the route-policy-
change notify-delay
command.

management, YANG, or commands. They can be configured only through configuration
delivery by the central device. For details, see "Simplified Architecture Configuration (the
Solar System Solution)" in the
S300, S500, S2700, S5700, and S6700 V200R024C00
Configuration Guide - Device Management.
Feature Limitations
None.
10.5 Configuring Filters
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring filters, configure routing protocols.
Configuration Procedure
Configure each of the filters in any sequence according to network requirements.
10.5.1 Configuring an IP Prefix List
Context
Configuring an IP prefix list controls the advertising and receiving of routes based
on the destination address.
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 10 Routing Policy Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 984
NOTICE
If an IP prefix list is not used together with the if-match clauses in a routing
policy, you must set at least one node to the permit mode in the IP prefix list. If
no node is set to the permit mode, all routes are filtered out.
Procedure
Step 1 Configure an IPv4 prefix list.
1. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
2. Run ip ip-prefix
ip-prefix-name [ index
index-number ] { permit | deny }
ipv4-address mask-length [ match-network ] [ greater-equal
greater-equal-
value ] [ less-equal
less-equal-value ]
An IPv4 prefix list is configured.
Step 2 Configure an IPv6 prefix list.
1. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
2. Run ip ipv6-prefix
ipv6-prefix-name [ index
index-number ] { permit | deny }
ipv6-address prefix-length [ match-network ] [ greater-equal
greater-equal-
value ] [ less-equal
less-equal-value ]
An IPv6 prefix list is configured.
----End
Verifying the Configuration
● Run the display ip ip-prefix [
ip-prefix-name ] command to check
information about the IPv4 prefix list.
● Run the display ip ipv6-prefix [
ipv6-prefix-name ] command to check
information about the IPv6 prefix list.
10.5.2 Configuring an AS_Path Filter
Context
An AS_Path filter is used to filter routes based on the AS_Path attributes of BGP
routes. If you do not want to receive routes of a specified AS number, configure an
AS_Path filter based on the specified AS number. On a complex network, multiple
ACLs or IP prefix lists must be configured to filter BGP routes. This can be a
complicated process; configuring an AS_Path filter can simplify the configuration.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 10 Routing Policy Configuration

Step 2 Run ip as-path-filter {
as-path-filter-number |
as-path-filter-name } { permit |
deny }
regular-expression
An AS_Path filter is configured.
In the preceding command,
regular-expression indicates that the AS_Path filter
uses a regular expression to define matching rules.
----End
Verifying the Configuration
● Run the display ip as-path-filter [
as-path-filter-number |
as-path-filter-
name ] command to check information about a configured AS_Path filter.
10.5.3 Configuring a Community Filter
Context
The community attribute identifies routes with the same characteristics without
considering IP prefixes and AS numbers. Configuring community filters and
community attributes simplifies route management when it is inconvenient to use
the IP prefix list or AS_Path filter. For example, a company branch needs to receive
routes only from its headquarters and from branches in adjacent countries. In this
case, you can configure different community attributes for each of the branches.
Routes in the original branch can then be managed based on community
attributes, without considering IP prefixes and AS numbers of routes in different
countries.
Community filters are classified into basic and advanced community filters. An
advanced community filter supports regular expressions and is more flexible than
a basic community filter.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ip community-filter
A community filter is configured.
● To configure a basic community filter, run the ip community-filter { basic
comm-filter-name |
basic-comm-filter-num } { permit | deny } [
community-
number |
aa:nn | internet | no-export-subconfed | no-advertise | no-export ]
&<1-20> command.
● To configure an advanced community filter, run the ip community-filter
{ advanced
comm-filter-name |
adv-comm-filter-num } { permit | deny }
regular-expression command.
In the preceding command,
regular-expression indicates that the community filter
uses a regular expression to define matching rules.

attribute to filter routes in a VPN.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ip extcommunity-filter {
basic-extcomm-filter-num | basic
basic-extcomm-
filter-name } { deny | permit } { rt {

about a configured extended community filter.
10.5.5 Configuring an RD Filter
Context
You can use an RD filter when using the RD attribute to filter routes in a VPN.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ip rd-filter
rd-filter-number { deny | permit }

Verifying the Configuration
● Run the display ip rd-filter [
rd-filter-number ] command to check
information about a configured RD filter.
10.6 Configuring a Routing Policy
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring a routing policy, configure routing protocols.
Configuration Procedure
Before configuring the if-match and apply clauses, you must configure a routing
policy. You can configure the if-match and apply clauses in any sequence
according to network requirements.
10.6.1 Creating a Routing Policy
Context
A routing policy can consist of multiple matching rules and actions.
NOTICE
You must set at least one node to the permit mode in a routing policy; otherwise,
all routes are filtered out.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run route-policy
route-policy-name { permit | deny } node
node
A routing policy is created, and the routing policy view is displayed.
When a routing policy is used to filter a route, the route is matched with nodes in
the routing policy in ascending order of node ID. Therefore, a route is first
matched with the node with the smallest node ID. If a route matches a node in
the routing policy, the system does not continue to match it with other nodes. If a
route fails to match all the nodes in the routing policy, the route is filtered out.
Step 3 (Optional) Run description
text
The description of the routing policy is configured.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 10 Routing Policy Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 988
NOTE
By default, the system does not allow a nonexistent route-policy to be specified in a
command. To enable the system to allow a nonexistent route-policy to be specified in a
command, run the route-policy nonexistent-config-check disable command.
----End
10.6.2 (Optional) Configuring an if-match Clause
Context
An if-match clause defines matching rules related to route filters and attributes in
a routing policy.
If no if-match clause is configured for a node in a routing policy, routes match the
routing policy in this node. If one or more if-match clauses are configured in a
node, the relationship between the clauses is "AND". This means that a route
matches this node only when they match all the if-match clauses in this node.
This rule does not apply to if-match as-path-filter, if-match community-filter,
if-match extcommunity-filter, if-match interface, or if-match route-type
clauses. The relationship between these clauses is "OR", and the relationship
between these clauses and other if-match clauses is "AND". For example, if
multiple if-match as-path-filter clauses are configured in a node, the relationship
between these clauses is "OR", and the relationship between these clauses and
other if-match clauses is "AND".
NOTE
If an if-match clause defines a filter that is not configured, all routes match this if-match
clause by default.
The if-match acl and if-match ip-prefix commands cannot be used together in the same
node. When both the commands are used in a node, the most recently configured one
overrides the previous one.
NOTICE
When modifying the configurations of cooperative routing policies with multiple
if-match clauses, it is recommended that you also perform the configuration task
of 10.8 Controlling the Valid Time of Routing Policies. Otherwise, an
incomplete routing policy will cause route flapping.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run route-policy
route-policy-name { permit | deny } node
node
The routing policy view is displayed.
Step 3 Configure if-match clauses in any sequence for a routing policy according to your
network requirements.

10.6.3 (Optional) Configuring an apply Clause
Context
An apply clause specifies the action of setting attributes for routes that have
matched a routing policy node. If a node does not have an apply clause
configured, the node will only filter routes. If one or more apply clauses are
configured in a node, all the apply clauses are applied to routes that have
matched the node.

10.6.4 (Optional) Enabling Further Route Matching Against a
Specified Node
Context
The relationship among the matching rules of nodes in the same route-policy is
OR. Specifically, if a route matches a node, it matches the route-policy and is no
longer matched against other nodes. If you want the route to be matched against
two or more nodes, run the goto next-node command so that the route is further
matched against a specified node after the route matches the current node.

after the routes match the current node.
● If
node is not specified in the command, the route will be further matched
against the next node of the current node by default.
● If the node specified in the command does not exist, the route will be further
matched against the next node of the specified node by default. If the next
node of the specified node does not exist either, the route fails to match the
route-policy, and no apply clause will be applied to the route.
----End
10.6.5 Applying a Route-Policy
Context
A route-policy can be applied to direct, static, RIP/RIPng, IS-IS, OSPF/OSPFv3, BGP/
BGP4+, multicast, and BGP/MPLS IP VPN routes. In addition, a route-policy can be
applied to an FRR scenario. Perform one of the following configurations as

iii. Run the ingress-lsp trigger route-policy
route-policy-name
command to enable the function of establishing ingress LSPs for
labeled BGP routes based on a route-policy.
On a MAN where the hybrid access mode is used, a large number of
BGP labeled routes are used to establish end-to-end LSPs. Some
intermediate nodes do not need to carry VPN services, but excessive
ingress LSPs are created, wasting network resources. In this situation,
run this command to establish ingress LSPs based on a route-policy
to reduce network resource consumption.
– To apply a route-policy in the VPN instance view, perform the following
operations:
i. Run the system-view command to enter the system view.
ii. Run the ip vpn-instance
vpn-instance-name command to enter the
VPN instance view.
iii. Perform either of the following operations as required:
○ To associate the current VPN instance address family with one
export route-policy, run the export route-policy
route-policy-
name command. Only one route-policy can be associated, and
the last associated route-policy takes effect.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 10 Routing Policy Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 1006
The export command can control route transmission between
different VPN instances on a PE, while the peer route-policy
export command can control only the VPNv4 or VPNv6 routes
that a PE sends to other PE peers.
○ To associate the current VPN instance address family with one
import route-policy, run the import route-policy
route-policy-
name command. Only one route-policy can be associated, and
the last associated route-policy takes effect.
The import route-policy command can control route receiving
between different VPN instances on a PE, while the peer route-
policy import command can control only the VPNv4 or VPNv6
routes that a PE sends to other PE peers.
● Apply a route-policy to an FRR scenario.

Routing information advertised by RIP may contain the routing
information imported from other protocols. You can use the
protocol
parameter to filter the routing information imported from a specified
routing protocol. If the
protocol parameter is not used, all the routes
advertised by RIP are filtered, including imported routes and local routes
(direct routes).
NOTE
RIP-2 defines a 16-bit tag, while other routing protocols define 32-bit tags. If the
routes of other routing protocols are imported into RIP and the tag is used in the
routing policy, the tag value cannot exceed 65535. If the tag value exceeds
65535, the routing policy becomes invalid or the matching result is incorrect.
● Configuring OSPF to filter advertised routes
a. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
b. Run ospf [

OSPF is configured to filter the routes imported using the import-route
command. Only the routes that pass the filtering criteria are advertised.
▪ The
acl-number parameter specifies the number of a basic ACL.
▪ The acl-name
acl-name parameter specifies the name of an ACL.
▪ The ip-prefix
ip-prefix-name parameter specifies the name of an IP
prefix list.
▪ The route-policy
route-policy-name parameter specifies the name of
a route policy.
To filter the routes of a specific routing protocol or OSPF process, specify
the
protocol [
process-id ] parameter. If this parameter is not specified,
OSPF filters all the imported routes.
NOTE
● The import-route command cannot import external default routes.
● OSPF filters imported routes and generates Type 5 LSAs to advertise only
external routes that pass the filtering criteria.
● Configuring IS-IS to filter advertised routes

10.10 Configuration Examples for Routing Policies
10.10.1 Example for Filtering the Routes to Be Received or
Advertised
Networking Requirements
Figure 10-19 shows how on an OSPF network, SwitchA receives routes from the
Internet and provides these routes for the OSPF network. A user wants devices on
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet

172.16.18.0/24, and 172.16.19.0/24, and SwitchC to access only the network
segment 172.16.18.0/24.

Device Interface VLANIF Interface IP Address
SwitchA GE0/0/1 VLANIF10 192.168.1.1/24
SwitchB GE0/0/1 VLANIF10 192.168.1.2/24
SwitchB GE0/0/2 VLANIF20 192.168.2.1/24
SwitchC GE0/0/1 VLANIF20 192.168.2.2/24
Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure a routing policy on SwitchA and apply the routing policy during
route advertisement. When routes are advertised, the routing policy allows
SwitchA to provide routes from network segments 172.16.17.0/24,
172.16.18.0/24, and 172.16.19.0/24 for SwitchB, and allows devices on the
OSPF network to access the three network segments.
2. Configure a routing policy on SwitchC and apply the routing policy during
route importing. When routes are imported, the routing policy allows SwitchC
to receive only the routes from the network segment 172.16.18.0/24 and
access this network segment.
Procedure
Step 1 Add interfaces to VLANs.

10.10.2 Example for Applying a Routing Policy for Importing
Routes
Networking Requirements
In Figure 10-20, SwitchB exchanges routing information with SwitchA through
OSPF, and with SwitchC through IS-IS. A user wants SwitchB to import IS-IS routes
into the OSPF network. The user also wants the route to 172.17.1.0/24 on the
OSPF network to have a low preference and the route to 172.17.2.0/24 to have a
tag, making it easy to reference by a routing policy.

Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure a routing policy on SwitchB, set the cost of the route to
172.17.1.0/24 to 100, and apply the routing policy when OSPF imports IS-IS
routes. The routing policy allows the route to 172.17.1.0/24 to have a low
preference.
2. Configure a routing policy on SwitchB, set the tag of the route to
172.17.2.0/24 to 20, and apply the routing policy when OSPF imports IS-IS
routes. This allows the tag of the route to 172.17.2.0/24 to take effect,
making it easy to reference by a routing policy.
Procedure
Step 1 Add interfaces to VLANs.
# Configure SwitchA. Ensure that the configurations of SwitchB, and SwitchC are
the same as the configuration of SwitchA.
<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] sysname SwitchA
[SwitchA] vlan batch 10
[SwitchA] interface gigabitethernet 0/0/1
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] port link-type trunk
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] port trunk allow-pass vlan 10
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] quit
Step 2 Assign IP addresses to VLANIF interfaces.
# Configure SwitchA. Ensure that the configurations of SwitchB, and SwitchC are
the same as the configuration of SwitchA.
[SwitchA] interface vlanif 10
[SwitchA-Vlanif10] ip address 192.168.1.1 24
[SwitchA-Vlanif10] quit
Step 3 Configure IS-IS.
# Configure SwitchC.
[SwitchC] isis
[SwitchC-isis-1] is-level level-2
[SwitchC-isis-1] network-entity 10.0000.0000.0001.00

[SwitchB-route-policy] apply tag 20
[SwitchB-route-policy] quit
[SwitchB] route-policy isis2ospf permit node 30
[SwitchB-route-policy] quit
Step 7 Apply the routing policy when routes are imported.
# Configure SwitchB and apply the routing policy when routes are imported.
[SwitchB] ospf
[SwitchB-ospf-1] import-route isis 1 route-policy isis2ospf
[SwitchB-ospf-1] quit
# Check the OSPF routing table on SwitchA. You can see that the cost of the route
to 172.17.1.0/24 is 100; the tag of the route to 172.17.2.0/24 is 20; other route
attributes remain unchanged.
