The negotiation auto port command configures an interface on an RU to work in auto-negotiation mode.

The undo negotiation auto port command configures an interface on an RU to work in non-auto-negotiation mode.

By default, an interface on an RU works in auto-negotiation mode.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In auto-negotiation mode, interfaces on both ends of a link negotiate their operating parameters, including the duplex mode and rate. If the negotiation succeeds, the two interfaces work at the same operating parameters and the transmission capability can reach the maximum value supported by both ends.

Follow-up Procedure

After running this command, run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.
Example

# Configure interface 8 on RU 0 to work in auto-negotiation mode.

[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
