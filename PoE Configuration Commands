Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Switches that comply with 802.3at or 802.3bt cannot power some non-standard PDs that do not support inrush current. To power these PDs, configure the power supply standards of interfaces as 802.3af.

Precautions

    The poe af-inrush enable command applies to the scenario where some non-standard PDs cannot be powered on. After this command is executed, some PDs requiring high current may be unable to be powered on.
    After running the poe af-inrush enable command, remove non-standard PDs and then install them so that they can be powered on.
    On the S5720-16X-PWH-LI-AC, S5720-28X-PWH-LI-AC, S5720I-SI, S2730S-S, S5735-L-I, S5735-L1, S300, S5735-L, S5735S-L1, S5735-S, S500, S5735-S-I, S5735S-H, S5736-S, S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-S, and S5732-H, the poe af-inrush enable and poe single-class enable commands are mutually exclusive and cannot be configured on the same interface.
    In an upgrade to V200R011C10 or later, if the poe af-inrush enable command is configured in the system view before the upgrade, the poe af-inrush enable command configuration is automatically generated on all interfaces after the upgrade.

Usage Guidelines

The mains frequency varies in different countries and regions. Some are 60 Hz and some are 50 Hz. When a device provide PoE power supply, incorrect grounding may occur. As a result, industrial frequency interference is coupled to network cables, resulting in abnormal PoE detection classification. You can run the poe anti-interference frequency command to modify the PoE anti-interference frequency on the device to make that become the same as the mains frequency, reducing the impact of the mains frequency on PoE detection.

poe { at-inrush | pre-bt-inrush | bt-inrush } enable
Function

The poe { at-inrush | pre-bt-inrush | bt-inrush } enable command changes the power supply mode of interfaces supporting the PoE++ mode.

The undo poe { at-inrush | pre-bt-inrush | bt-inrush } enable command restores the default power supply mode of PoE interfaces.

By default, interfaces supporting the PoE++ mode on devices provide power in PoE++ mode. That is, the power supply mode is bt-inrush, interfaces not supporting the PoE++ mode on devices provide power in at-inrush mode.

Only the MultiGE interface of an S5720-28X-PWH-LI-AC, the first 12 electrical interfaces of an S5720-16X-PWH-LI-AC, the first 8 electrical interfaces of an S5720I-28X-PWH-SI-AC, and electrical interfaces of the S5720I-12X-PWH-SI-DC, S2730S-S, S5735-L-I, S5735-L1,S300, S5735-L, S5735S-L1, S5735-S, S500, S5735-S-I, S5731-H, S5731S-H, S5731-S, S5731S-S, and S5732-H support this command.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To power the PDs requiring the standard power supply mode, run the poe at-inrush enable command. This command changes the power supply mode of the PoE interface to the PoE+ mode. If most of the parameters supported by the PDs requiring high power comply with 802.3at, run the poe pre-bt-inrush enable command to change the power supply mode of these interfaces to PoE++ compatible.

Precautions

    When the poe bt-inrush enable command is configured after the poe af-inrush enable command is configured in the interface, the poe af-inrush enable command configuration is automatically overwritten.
    The poe { pre-bt-inrush | bt-inrush } enable and poe single-class enable commands are mutually exclusive and cannot be configured on the same interface.
    Changing the power supply mode of a PoE interface will power off the PD connected to this PoE interface.
    After the power supply mode of an interface is set to bt-inrush, forcible PoE power supply and PD compatibility check configured on this interface using the poe force-power and poe legacy enable commands respectively do not take effect on this interface.
    After the power supply mode of an interface is set to bt-inrush, and the interface detects that it connects to a non-standard PD, confirm whether this interface is connected to a PD. If so, run the poe pre-bt-inrush enable command and the poe legacy enable or poe force-power command to provide power to this PD.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenarios

Before providing power for the PD connected to an interface, ensure that the PoE function has been enabled on the interface. If the PoE function is not enabled on the interface, run the poe enable command to enable the PoE function on the interface.

In automatic mode, PD power-on and power-off on interfaces are determined by the PoE power and interface power priority. When the PoE power is sufficient, the device does not power off the PD connected to any interface. To stop providing power for a PD, run the undo poe enable command on the interface to which the PD is connected.

Precautions

The device only supports PoE power supply on downlink interfaces and does not support PoE power supply on uplink interfaces.
Example
# Disable the PoE function on GigabitEthernet0/0/3.

poe fast-on enable
Function

The poe fast-on enable command enables fast power-on for a PoE interface.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

After a PoE switch is powered off and then restarts, interfaces on this device can be powered on again only after a certain period. As a result, PDs connected to these interfaces are powered off within this period. To shorten the time during which the PDs are powered off, you can run the poe fast-on enable command on the PoE switch. After the PoE switch is powered off and then restarts, PoE interfaces can rapidly resume power supply to PDs.

Precautions

    This command takes effect only during cold startup of the device.
    The poe fast-on enable command does not generate any configuration but always takes effect after being executed until the undo poe fast-on enable command is executed. To determine whether the fast power-on configuration takes effect, run the display poe power-state command to check the fast-on field.

Usage Scenario

If the power of the system is sufficient, you can run the poe force-power command on the interface connected to PDs when the PSE cannot detect the PDs.

Precautions

After the power supply mode of an interface is set to PoE++ using the poe bt-inrush enable command, the poe force-power command does not take effect on this interface.

The poe force-power command and the poe legacy enable command are mutually exclusive. When configured on the same interface, the later configured command takes effect and the earlier configured command is cleared.

If the interface connects to a non-PD device, configuring forcible powering on the interface may damage the non-PD device. Exercise caution when using the poe force-power command. After forcible powering is configured on a PoE switch, you must delete the forcible powering configuration from the switch if you need to remove the switch from the current networking environment and deploy it in a new networking environment.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Powering on some PDs may affect other PDs, causing other PDs unable to be detected by a PoE device. After group management of PDs is enabled, a PoE device can detect PDs on a per-group basis and power on these PDs in a batch.

Precautions

    To support a PoE device's group management of PDs, every four interfaces on the left are added to one group. For example, interfaces numbered 1 to 4 or numbered 5 to 8 can be added to one group, but interfaces numbered 2 to 5 cannot. That is, the number of the last interface in each group must be the multiple of 4. If the poe group management enable command is configured on any interface in a group, this command is also delivered to the other three interfaces in the same group.

    After group management of PDs is configured on an interface, the other interfaces in the same group use the same power supply priority as this interface and this priority is lower than that of other interfaces that are not added to any group. If some interfaces have this group management function configured, the PoE interface power supply priority configured using the poe priority command does not take effect on these interfaces.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenarios

By default, a PoE device works in automatic power management mode. After a PD is connected to a PoE device, the PoE device automatically provides power for the PD.

After you run the poe power-management command to configure the power management mode of a PoE device to manual, the PoE device does not automatically provide power for PDs when PDs are connected to the PoE device. You need to run the poe power-on interface command to manually power on the interfaces of the PoE device. Check whether the interface is powered on based on the Power ON/OFF field in the display poe power-state command.

Precautions

When the available power of the device is insufficient and the device cannot provide power for a new PD, the poe power-on interface command is invalid.

Pre-configuration Tasks

Before powering on or powering off an interface, ensure that:

    The power management mode has been in manual mode through running the poe power-management command.

    PDs have been connected to the interface.

    The PoE function of the interface has been enabled.

    The classification of the PDs connected to the interface has finished and the PDs have been ready for being powered on.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

After the switch is enabled to check the compatibility of PDs, the switch can detect and provide power to the PDs that do not comply with the 802.3af or 802.3at standard or the standard PDs that are detected as non-standard PDs because of the external environment. If compatibility check is disabled, the switch cannot provide power to the non-standard PDs.

After interfaces are enabled to check the compatibility of PDs, the interfaces can provide power to both standard and non-standard PDs. This configuration does not affect the power supply of standard PDs. That is, the interfaces can still provide power to standard PDs after the poe legacy enable command is configured.

Precautions

After the power supply mode of an interface is set to PoE++ using the poe bt-inrush enable command, the poe legacy enable command does not take effect on this interface.

The poe force-power command and the poe legacy enable command are mutually exclusive. When configured on the same interface, the later configured command takes effect and the earlier configured command is cleared.

If the interface is connected to a non-PD device, enabling PD compatibility check may damage this non-PD device. Exercise caution when you use this command. After enabling PD compatibility check on a PoE switch, you need to manually disable this function if you need to remove the switch from the current networking environment and deploy it in a new networking environment.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario
Hybrid optical/electrical cables integrate optical fibers and electrical cables and are used to connect S5732-H48XUM2CC switches to APs. Hybrid optical/electrical cables are often used in the following scenarios:

    One end of the RJ45 cable in a hybrid optical/electrical cable is connected to a MultiGE electrical port of a switch, and the other end is connected to the RJ45 power receiving port of an AP. The RJ45 cable is used only for the switch to provide PoE power supply for the AP and does not transmit data.

    One end of the optical fiber in a hybrid optical/electrical cable is connected to a 10GE optical port on a switch, and the other end is connected to an uplink 10GE optical port on an AP. The optical fiber is used for data transmission between the switch and AP.

Since the MultiGE electrical port connected to a hybrid optical/electrical cable stays in the down state, to use LLDP to negotiate the power supply capability, you must run the poe lldp-proxy command to configure the 10GE optical port on the switch connected to the hybrid optical/electrical cable as a proxy for the MultiGE electrical port to perform LLDP negotiation.

Precautions

    LLDP must be enabled on the 10GE optical port connected to a hybrid optical/electrical cable. This function is enabled by default.
    If an AP requires PoE++ power supply, run the poe legacy enable command on the 10GE optical port connected to a hybrid optical/electrical cable to enable compatibility check.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

During PoE power supply negotiation between a PSE and a PD, the PSE considers the PD online and provides power to the PD only when the current holding time and current amplitude within the detection interval are within the specified thresholds according to the protocol standards. However, some non-standard PDs cannot meet the threshold requirements on the current holding time and current amplitude within the detection interval specified in the protocol standards. As a result, the PSE does not provide power to these PDs. In this case, you can run this command to specify the thresholds of PoE power supply negotiation parameters so that the switch can provide power to non-standard PDs.

Precautions
The following four commands are mutually exclusive. If three of them are configured on the device, the other command cannot be configured.

    poe af-inrush enable
    poe legacy enable
    poe power-on delay (The delay is set to a value in the range from 13 to 22.)

For example, if the poe af-inrush enable, poe legacy enable, and poe power-on delay 14 commands are configured on the device, the poe mps command cannot be configured. If the poe af-inrush enable, poe legacy enable, and poe mps commands are configured on the device, the poe power-on delay 14 command cannot be configured, but the poe power-on delay 10 command can be configured.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

By default, the switch supplies power to the APs connected to interfaces in compliance with IEEE 802.3at (the maximum output power is 30 W). Some APs support both IEEE 802.3at and 802.3af. The switch can supply power to these APs in accordance with IEEE 802.3af (the maximum output power is 15.4 W). When the APs connected to the switch support both IEEE 802.3at and 802.3af, enable power auto-negotiation on the interfaces connected to these APs. When the total available power of the switch is less than 30 W and the switch detects that the current power supply standards of an AP are IEEE 802.3at, the switch can send an LLDP packet to the AP to enable the AP to set its power supply standards to IEEE 802.3af. Power auto-negotiation changes only the power supply standards of APs but not the interfaces to which the APs are connected.

Enabling power auto-negotiation on interfaces will change the power supply standards of the APs connected to the interfaces, reduce the power consumption of the APs, and enable the switch to supply power to more APs when the rated output power of the switch is fixed.

Precautions

    The poe power auto-neg enable command is mutually exclusive with the lldp dot3-tlv power 802.1ab force and lldp dot3-tlv power 802.3at commands and cannot be configured together.
    When the total available power of the switch is less than 30 W, the power supply standards of all the APs connected to the interfaces that have power auto-negotiation enabled will be set to IEEE 802.3af. When the total available power of the switch is more than the larger value of 60 W and reserved power, the power supply standards of the APs connected to the interfaces will be restored to IEEE 802.3at based on the power supply priority configured on the interfaces. That is, the power supply standards of the AP connected to the interface with a higher priority are restored to IEEE 802.3at. If the power supply priority of these interfaces is the same, the power supply standards of the AP connected to the interface with a smaller interface number are restored to IEEE 802.3at first.
    Disabling power auto-negotiation on an interface will restore the power supply standards of the AP connected to the interface to IEEE 802.3at. This operation will power off the APs connected to some interfaces if the total power of the switch is insufficient.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenarios

In automatic power management mode, the device first provides power for the interfaces with higher priority and powers off the interfaces of lower priority when the power is insufficient. When the power is sufficient, all interfaces connected to PDs are powered on. To stop providing power for some interfaces, run the undo poe enable command to disable the PoE function on the interfaces. If the PoE function is enabled and disabled frequently, faults may occur on the interfaces. To prevent the faults, you can set the power management mode to manual mode. In manual mode, the power-on and power-off of an interface are controlled manually and not affected by the interface power priority.

Precautions

    If all the interfaces are of the same priority, the power supply priority of the interface with a smaller interface number is higher in automatic mode.

    You can view the power management mode by running the display poe information command.

Follow-up Procedures

After setting the power management mode to manual, you need to run the poe { power-off | power-on } interface command to manually power on or off the PDs connected to interfaces of the device. If the device restarts after being powered off, you need to run the power-on command on the interfaces again to power on the PDs connected to the interfaces. If the device restarts without being powered off, you do not need to run the power-on command on the interfaces again to power on the PDs.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The poe power-off time-range command makes a PoE power-off time range set in the system view effective on an interface. If the current time is within the specified time range, the PD connected to the interface cannot be powered on.

The undo poe power-off time-range command cancels the configuration. The time range does not take effect on the PD connected to the interface; however, the configuration of the time range is still saved.

Pre-configuration Tasks

Before running the poe power-off time-range command, you must ensure a PoE power-off time range has been configured through running the time-range command in the system view.
Example
# Configure a PoE power-off time range from 10:00 to 11:00 for PDs connected to GigabitEthernet0/0/1.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The maintain current of the used PD is insufficient at the power-on moment, so the PoE switch considers that the PD has been disconnected and powers it off. IEEE standards require that a PD must maintain a current value of more than 10 mA for at least 75 ms in each 325 ms duration. Otherwise, the PoE switch considers that the PD has left and powers off the PD.

To enable the PoE switch to power these non-standard PDs, set the PoE power supply delay on the appropriate interfaces of the switch so that the switch detects the maintain power of the PDs after the specified delay.

Precautions

After the PoE power supply delay is configured on an interface, do not replace the PD connected to this interface within the delay. Otherwise, the new PD cannot work properly.
Example
# Set the PoE power supply delay to 5 seconds on GigabitEthernet0/0/1.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenarios

The device can dynamically allocate power to each interface according to the power consumption of each interface. The power consumption of a PD keeps changing when the PD is running. The system periodically calculates the total power consumption of all the PDs. If the total power consumption exceeds the upper threshold of the device, the system powers off the PDs on the interfaces of low priority. If interfaces have the same priority, the system powers off the PD on the interface with a larger port number.

Sometimes, however, the power consumption increases sharply and the available power of the system cannot support the burst increase of power. At this time, the system has not calculated and found that the total power consumption exceeded the upper threshold; therefore, the system does not cut off power low-priority interfaces in time. As a result, the PoE power supply is shut down for overload protection, and all PDs are powered off.

This problem can be solved by running the poe power-reserved command to set proper reserved power. When there is a burst increase in power consumption, the reserved power can support the system running. Then the system has time to power off interfaces of low priority to ensure stable running of other PDs.

Precautions

    The reserved power should not be set greater than 20%. If the reserved PoE power is greater than 20% of the total PoE power, the power capacity of the device is affected.
    To set the maximum output power of a device, run the poe max-power command. In this case, the device calculates the reserved power based on the set maximum output power. If the maximum output power is not set, the available PoE power is the power provided by the PoE power module.

Example

# Set the percentage of reserved PoE power to the total PoE power to 30%.

Usage Guidelines

When PSE power supply heartbeat detection of a switch is abnormal because the internal channel of the switch is problematic, the PoE function of the switch triggers firmware loading again. As a result, PDs connected to ports of the switch are powered off. To reduce abnormal PoE power supply caused by an internal channel exception, you can run this command to disable PSE power supply heartbeat detection.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario
The S5720I-28X-PWH-SI-AC has two built-in power modules, which support two PoE power supply modes:

    High-power mode (default): When two power modules are used, they provide 369.6 W PoE power for the first 8 electrical ports and last 16 electrical ports respectively, and the system provides 739.2 W PoE power. If one of the two power modules is faulty, the first 8 electrical interfaces provide power normally, but the PDs connected to the last 16 electrical ports are powered off and the PoE function becomes unavailable on the last 16 electrical ports. When only one power module is used, only the first 8 electrical interfaces can provide PoE power.
    PoE backup mode: The PoE power supply mode can be manually set to the backup mode using the poe-power backup-mode command. The backup mode provides 1+1 redundancy. In backup mode, the system provides 369.6 W PoE power, regardless of whether one or two power modules are used. The 369.6 W PoE power is shared by 24 electrical ports. Setting the PoE power supply mode to the backup mode can improve system stability.

Precautions

Changing the PoE power supply mode will power off the PDs connected to all ports.

# Set the PoE power supply mode to the backup mode.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

By default, a PoE interface works in standard hierarchical power supply mode. If PoE interfaces provide power to non-standard PDs in standard hierarchical power supply mode, these PDs cannot initiate power requests using LLDP or CDP and can only obtain a low power. As a result, these PDs cannot work normally. To address this issue, run the poe single-class enable command to configure the single-class power supply mode for PoE interfaces. These non-standard PDs can then initiate power requests and obtain the standard power supply to work normally.
Precautions

    If a standard PD is connected to the interface, this PD may be unable to work normally after the poe single-class enable command is run.
    On the S5720-16X-PWH-LI-AC, S5720-28X-PWH-LI-AC, S5720I-SI, S2730S-S, S5735-L-I, S5735-L1, S300, S5735-L, S5735S-L1, S5735-S, S500, S5735-S-I, S5735S-H, S5736-S, S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-S, and S5732-H, the poe af-inrush enable and poe single-class enable commands are mutually exclusive and cannot be configured on the same interface.
