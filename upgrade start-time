Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The firmware upgrade of an RU consists of two steps:

    The RU loads firmware of the new version. In this step, the central switch sends the firmware package of the new version to the RU.
    The RU restarts to make firmware of the new version take effect.

You can run the upgrade start-time command to configure RUs to restart with firmware of the new version at a specified time. This command configures the restart time in step 2.

Precautions

During the BIOS firmware upgrade of RUs, do not power off or disconnect the RUs. Otherwise, the RUs cannot be started.

After you run the upgrade start-time command to configure RUs to restart with firmware of the new version at a specified time, other upgrade commands that have been configured are overwritten. That is, RUs will restart with firmware of the new version at the time specified by the upgrade start-time command.
Example

# Configure RUs to restart with firmware of the new version at midnight.
