Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If the firmware version of an RU is different from that in the system software package or patch package of the central switch, the central switch does not automatically upgrade the firmware version of the RU. You can run the upgrade right-now command to upgrade the firmware of all RUs. After the upgrade right-now command is run, the system checks whether the firmware version of an RU is the same as that in the system software package or patch package of the central switch. If not, the RU immediately loads the firmware package of the new version and restarts with new firmware.

Prerequisites

RUs are online and in the normal state.

Precautions

    RUs will restart after loading firmware packages, resulting in service interruption. To prevent this issue, upgrade RUs at a proper time.
    Do not power off RUs during the upgrade. Otherwise, RUs may fail to start.
    Only the firmware of the RUs that go online before the command is run is upgraded. To upgrade RUs that go online later, you need to run this command again.
    This command is executed only once and is not recorded in Buildrun information. You can run the display remote-unit upgrade information command to check whether an RU is being upgraded.
    After you run the upgrade right-now command, RUs are upgraded immediately. The upgrade cutoff-time and upgrade start-time upgrade commands that have been configured are overwritten.
