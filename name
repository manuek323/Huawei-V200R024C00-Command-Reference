Usage Guidelines

If a central switch is connected to multiple RUs, you can configure an alias for each RU to facilitate management, since aliases are easier to remember than IDs. In addition, after specifying an alias for an RU, you can run the remote-unit name remote-unit-name command to enter the view of an RU by its alias directly.
Example

# Set the alias of RU 0 to access_1.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
[HUAWEI-remote-unit-0] name access_1
