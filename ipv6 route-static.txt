ipv6 route-static
Function

The ipv6 route-static command configures an IPv6 static route.

The undo ipv6 route-static command deletes configured IPv6 static routes.

By default, no IPv6 static route is configured.

Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

dest-ipv6-address
	

Specifies a destination IPv6 address.
	

The value is a 32-bit hexadecimal number, in X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X format.

prefix-length
	

Specifies the length of an IPv6 prefix.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 0 to 128.

interface-type interface-number
	

Specifies the type and number of an outbound interface.
	

-

vpn-instance vpn-destination-name
	

Specifies the name of a VPN instance. If the VPN instance name is specified, a switch searches the routing table of the VPN instance for the outbound interface of a static route according to the configured next-hop address. If the nexthop-ipv6-address parameter is not specified, a device searches a specified VPN instance forwarding table to find a forwarding path.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 31 case-sensitive characters with spaces. If the string is enclosed in double quotation marks (" "), the string can contain spaces.

nexthop-ipv6-address
	

Specifies the next-hop IPv6 address.
	

The value is a 32-bit hexadecimal number, in X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X format.

preference preference
	

Specifies the preference of an IPv6 static route.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 255. The default value is 60.

tag tag
	

Specifies the tag value of a static route. By configuring different tag values, you can classify static routes to implement different routing policies. For example, routing protocols can import static routes with specified tag values through routing policies.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 4294967295. The default value is 0.

track bfd-session cfg-name
	

Binds a static BFD session to a static route for fast fault detection.
	

cfg-name is a string of 1 to 15 characters without spaces. The string can contain spaces if it is enclosed with double quotation marks (").

track nqa admin-name test-name
	

Specifies the administrator name of an NQA test instance bound to a static route, and the name of the test instance.
	

The values of admin-name and test-name are both a string of 1 to 32 case-sensitive characters without spaces.

description text
	

Specifies the description of a static route.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 80 characters that can contain spaces.

all
	

Deletes all IPv6 static routes.
	

-

Only the S5720I-SI, S5735-S, S5735-S-I, S5735S-H, S5736-S, S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6720S-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support track bfd-session cfg-name parameters.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

On a simple network, you can configure static routes to ensure network connectivity. If a device cannot use dynamic routing protocols for network connectivity, static routes can also be configured on the device.

You can specify description text to add a description for a static route so that the administrator can easily query and maintain the static route. To view the description of static routes, run the display this command in the system view or run the display current-configuration command.

Precautions

When configuring unicast static routes, note the following:

    If no preference is set for a static route, the static route uses the default preference 60.
    The outbound interface of a static route cannot be a Layer 2 interface.

    If the destination address and mask of a static route are all 0s, the static route is a default route.
