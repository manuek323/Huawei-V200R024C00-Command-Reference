3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

On the device, service modules generate logs and control the log volume. The information center processes the received logs.

When the number of logs that are generated within a specified period (T) exceeds the threshold, the service module, with the buffer mechanism, saves extra logs to the buffer and does not send them to the information center.

You can run the display buffer command to view statistics about log information in the buffer.
Example

# Display statistics about logs cached in the buffer on the service module L2IF.

Usage Guidelines

ID identifies each function module for log registration. An ID filter list is the aggregation of the shielded IDs.

If id or bymodule-alias is not specified, all information is filtered.

If you do not want to output a specific log to the log file or log buffer, you can find the ID of the log in the data dictionary and run the info-center filter-id command to inject the ID into the filter list. Then, you can run the display info-center filter-id command to check whether the ID has become the one to be filtered.
Example
# Display all the IDs in the filter list.

<HUAWEI> display info-center filter-id

Usage Guidelines

When encountering problems, you can query log information to know about what happened during device operation. This is helpful for fault location.

The file name is generated automatically by the system. The file name extension of the log file is *.log or *.dblg. When the current log file size reaches the specified upper limit, the system compresses the file into a *.log.zip or *.dblg.zip file.

You can view the *.log files or *.log.zip files. When viewing a *.log.zip file, you can press Ctrl+C to abort command execution.

When viewing the *.log.zip file, it is recommended that the length of the file name (including the driver and path) not exceed 62 bytes. Otherwise, the content of the file may fail to be viewed.

If the files you filter based on the pipe character are large and no qualified log file is displayed, the command fails to display any output for a long period of time until the command execution finishes.

For details about the log format, see "Log Message Format Description" in the S300, S500, S2700, S5700, and S6700 V200R024C00 Log Reference - Introduction.

Usage Guidelines
Usage Scenario

During device running, the information center records device operation. The system outputs system information to destinations such as the log host and the console only after the information center is enabled. Network administrators can store and query output information to monitor device running and locate faults.
Precautions

After the undo info-center enable or info-center disable command is executed, only logfile, logbuffer, and user session record logs, the other channel no longer records logs.
Follow-up Procedure

Configure a rule for outputting information to the terminal or remote server.
Example

# Enable the information center.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] info-center enable
Info: Information center is enabled.              

info-center filter-id
Function

The info-center filter-id command configures the Switch to filter a specified log or trap.

The undo info-center filter-id command disables the Switch from filtering a specified log or trap.

By default, no log or trap is filtered.
Format

info-center filter-id { id | bymodule-alias modname alias } &<1-50>

info-center filter-id { id | bymodule-alias modname alias } [ bytime interval | bynumber number ]

undo info-center filter-id all

undo info-center filter-id { id | bymodule-alias modname alias } &<1-50>

undo info-center filter-id { id | bymodule-alias modname alias } [ bytime interval | bynumber number ]
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

id
	

Specifies the ID of the log or trap to be filtered.
NOTE:

This parameter indicates the ID of a log. If this parameter fails to be configured, the log specified by this ID does not exist.
	

The value is in hexadecimal notation and contains 8 digits. The value contains 0-9, a-f, and A-F.

bymodule-alias modname alias
	

Specifies the module name and alias name corresponding to the log or trap to be filtered.
	

Enumerated type. Set the value according to the device configuration.

all
	

Filters all logs or traps.
	

-

bytime interval
	

Specifies the interval at which logs are sent.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 86400, in seconds.

bynumber number
	

Specifies the number of logs that are discarded between two received logs.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 1000.

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If some logs or traps are unnecessary, configure the Switch not to output the logs and traps. When the filtering function is enabled, the information center does not send the traps with a specified ID that satisfy the filtering condition to any channel. As a result, the trap buffer, console, terminal, or SNMP agent cannot receive the traps with the specified ID.

Precautions

    Currently, the Switch can filter traps with a maximum of 50 IDs. If there are more than 50 log IDs, the system displays a message indicating that the filtering table is full. To configure the filtering function, run the undo info-center filter-id { id | bymodule-alias modname alias } &<1-50> [ bytime interval | bynumber number ], or the undo info-center filter-id all command to delete original IDs and reconfigure the log ID.
    When both the bytime interval and bynumber number parameters are not specified, all the logs with the specified ID will be discarded.
    When the bytime interval parameter is specified, the interval for sending two allowed logs must be at least the configured time.
    When the bynumber number parameter is specified, the configured number of logs between two allowed logs must be discarded.
    To add multiple IDs at a time, use a space to separate every two IDs. The result of adding each ID is displayed.

    You cannot add the same ID or alias name repeatedly.

    When you add an unregistered or nonexistent ID or alias name, the system displays a message indicating that the system fails to filter the log or trap with the specified ID or alias name.

    During a software upgrade, if the information filtering function is configured in the old version, but the new version does not support the specified log module and alias, the information filtering configuration of the specified log module and alias will be automatically cleared after the upgrade.

    You are advised to use the module name and alias to filter specified log information. The id parameter can be obtained by running the display info-center register-info [ module module-name ] log command in the diagnostic view, and the modname and alias parameters can be obtained through the command association function.

Example
# Filter information by module names and alias names.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] info-center filter-id bymodule-alias CMD CMD_PRI_REARRG

# Cancel filtering for all logs.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] undo info-center filter-id all

# Filter the log with the ID of 40394017.

<HUAWEI> system-view

info-center local log-counter disable
Function

The info-center local log-counter disable command disables the local log from carrying the sequence number.

The undo info-center local log-counter disable command enables the local log to carry the sequence number.

By default, the local log carries the sequence number.

    You can run the info-center local log-counter disable command to disable logs sent to the log buffer, log file, console, or terminal from carrying the sequence number, and run the undo info-center local log-counter disable command to enable these logs to carry the sequence number.
    You can run the undo info-center local log-counter disable command to enable logs to carry the incremental sequence number, checking whether all logs have been sent to the log buffer, log file, console, or terminal.

    Logs sent to the console log file, or terminal are counted separately and therefore carry different sequence numbers in ascending order. The sequence number of the earliest log is 0.

    Logs sent to the log buffer carry sequence numbers in descending order. The sequence number of the latest log is 0.

Example

# Disable local logs from carrying the sequence number.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] info-center local log-counter disable

# Enable local logs to carry the sequence number.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] undo info-center local log-counter disable

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To query information generated on the Switch deployed remotely, configure the Switch to export information to a log host so that you can view device information on the log host. Run the info-center loghost command to configure the Switch to export information to a log host.

To configure the Switch to output information to different log hosts using different channels, specify the channels used to send information to the log hosts. For example, you can configure the Switch to output information to log hosts at 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 using channels 7 and 8 respectively.

Precautions

The Switch can output information to eight log hosts including IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to implement backup among log hosts.

To transfer logs to the log hosts using TCP and encrypt logs using SSL, create an SSL policy first.
If the set net-manager vpn-instance command is run to configure the NMS to manage network elements through a VPN instance, either of the following situations occurs.

    If vpn-instance is configured, the system accesses the log host in the VPN instance.

    If public-net is configured, the system accesses the log host on the public network.

If the transport tcp ssl-policy policy-name parameters are specified to enable logs to be transmitted in TCP mode through SSL encryption, perform the following operations:

    Run the ssl-policy policy-name command to configure an SSL policy and enter the SSL policy view.
    Run the trusted-ca load command to load trusted-CA files (cacert and rootcert files) of the SSL client.
    On the log server, load trusted-CA files (serverkey and servercert files) of the SSL server.
    Run the display tcp status command to check that the TCP connection status of port 6514 is Established.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If multiple devices send log messages to the same log host, you can identify the devices by setting different source interfaces so as to index the received log messages.

The source interface specified in the info-center loghost source command for a device to send logs to a log host is not necessarily the actual interface that sends the logs, but the IP address of the specified source interface is carried in logs.

Prerequisites

There is a reachable route between the source interface and the log host.
Example

# Specify Loopback0 IP address as the source interface address to send information to a log host.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] interface loopback 0

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If too many log files are saved on the Switch, many disk space resources are occupied. To view log files generated recently, run the info-center max-logfile-number command to set the maximum number of log files that can be saved.

Precautions

If the number of log files generated on the Switch exceeds the limit, the system deletes the oldest log file so that the number of log files is not larger than the maximum value.

If the number of saved log files is greater than the default value, more system resources are consumed. The default value is recommended. Excess log files can be deleted automatically. When the system deletes excess log files, high CPU usage may last for a short period.

Default Level
3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

You can run the info-center rate-limit threshold command to set the maximum number of logs with the same log ID that the information center can process every second. The information center monitors the number of logs that are generated every second under the same log ID. When the number of logs that are generated every second under the same log ID exceeds the threshold in the monitoring period, the information center decides that too many logs are generated and suppresses its log processing rate by processing only the conforming traffic (logs within the threshold) and discarding the non-conforming traffic (logs exceeding the threshold). When the number of logs that are generated every second under the same log ID falls below the threshold and remains below the threshold for five monitoring periods, the information center removes the suppression.
By default, the information center processes a maximum of 30 logs with the same log ID in every second. In certain application scenarios, by default, the information center needs to process more than 50 logs with the same log ID in every second. You can set thresholds for logs with different log IDs. Generally, the default threshold is recommended.

    If the threshold is too low, some logs may be discarded.
    If the threshold is too high, the information center cannot identify the log ID under which too many logs are generated.

    If the threshold value1 specified by the parameter byinfoid infoID or bymodule-alias modname alias differs from the threshold value0 specified globally, value1 takes effect.
    During a software upgrade, if the threshold is configured in the old version, but the new version does not support the specified log module and alias, the threshold configuration of the specified log module and alias will be automatically cleared after the upgrade.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The user session logging function saves the user input, device screen output, and time when the device executes the commands entered by users to a session log file. If the device becomes faulty or services become abnormal, you can obtain the user operation records from the saved session log file for fault location.

A session log file is generated in each VTY window and named cli_channel name.log, for example: cli_vty1.log. The generated session log files are stored in the sessionlog directory. The file size cannot exceed 1 MB.

If the number of session log files exceed the maximum value 20 (cannot be changed), the system compresses the files into .zip files. The compressed file is named cli_slot ID_timestamp_channel name_host name.log.zip, for example: cli_11_20171129081148_vty1_huawei.log.zip.

If the remaining device space is less than 30 MB, the system deletes the earliest log files until the remaining device space is more than 30 MB.

Precautions

Using the undo info-center enable or info-center disable command disables the information center will not affect the user session logging function. This function can only be enabled or disabled using the undo info-center session log disable or info-center session log disable command.

informational
	

A normal operation is performed. For example, a display command is run.

7
	

debugging
	

A normal operation is performed, which requires no attention.

Precautions

Each information channel has a default record with the module name default. The default configuration for logs, traps, and debugging messages in different channels may differ.
If a module generates a large number of logs, traps, or debugging messages in a short time, use the following methods to suppress this information:

    Specify level severity to adjust the channel level. Information with lower severity will be filtered.
    Specify state off to disable information sent by a specified module.

After the lowest severity of output information is specified, information lower than the severity will be filtered.
Example

# Enable the device to send debugging messages of the CFM module through the log host channel, and set the lowest severity of output debugging messages to warning.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In the system, service modules generate logs and control the volume of generated logs. The information center processes the received logs.
A large number of repeated logs are generated in a short time in some scenarios, for example, when ARP and VRRP are enabled. This wastes both the storage space and CPU resources. Generally, users do not want to view the repeated logs. You can run the info-center statistic-suppress enable command to suppress statistics on consecutive repeated logs so that the system can still record other logs.
Logs that are generated consecutively and with the identical log ID and parameters can be regarded as repeatedly generated logs.

Precautions

Statistics about repeatedly generated logs are first output at the 30th seconds from the time the first log is output, and then statistics about repeatedly generated logs are output at the 120th seconds. After being output two times, statistics about repeatedly generated logs are output every 600 seconds.
By default, once receiving a log, the information center outputs the log. If the information center receives repeatedly generated logs within a period, it outputs the number of these logs and will output logs only when it receives a new log (a log with a different log ID). For example, a module sends logs to the information center in the sequence of A1(T1) A2(T2) A3(T2) B1(T3) B2(T4) B3(T4) C1(T5) C2(T6) A4(T7) B4(T8) B5(T8) B5(T8) B7(T9) A5(T9) B8(T10) D1(T11) A6(T11) A7(T12) A8(T12) A9(T13) A10(T14) A11(T15) A12(T16) A13(T17) A14(T18) B9(T18). A1 to A14 are the same; B1 to B9 are the same; C1, C2 and D1 are different from others; T1 to T18 are sequence numbers. The log information output by the information center is as follows:

T1:A1
T3(1): last message repeated 2 times
T3:B1
T5: last message repeated 2 times
T5:C1
T6:C2
T7:A4
T8:B4
T9(1): last message repeated 3 times
T9:A5
T10:B8
T11:D1
T11:A6
T13(2): last message repeated 3 times
T18(2): last message repeated 5 times
T18:B9

Logs of the service module received by the information center show that:

    Statistics about repeatedly generated logs are output when either of the following conditions is met:
        The next log is a different log, as shown in (1).
        The time period (every 30 seconds, 120 seconds, and 600 seconds) for outputting log statistics expires, as shown in (2).
    Each time the statistics are output, the service module clears the count and starts counting again. For example, during the period from T11 to T18, log A is generated 9 times.
    The information center outputs logs in the same sequence the logs are generated, making the trace of information and scenario easy.

Logs with the sequence being A B A B A B A B are alternate logs; therefore, the info-center statistic-suppress enable command is unable to suppression the statistics about these logs.
Example

# Disable suppression of statistics about consecutive repeated logs.

Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When a device generates debugging, log, or trap information, the information queues in the device process and is sent to a terminal sequentially. This output is called a synchronous output.

A synchronous output provides effectively organized output information, improving user experience. In asynchronous output mode, multiple types of information interlaces, which brings poor readability. An asynchronous output allows you to promptly obtain debugging and diagnosis information and therefore applies to debugging and diagnosis scenarios.

You can run the terminal echo synchronous command to enable a synchronous output on a terminal, facilitating subsequent operations.

    When you enter a command, the entered command content is displayed after debugging, log, or trap information is displayed. This function is enabled by default. After a synchronous output is disabled, this function is still supported.
    When no command is entered, the command prompt is displayed after debugging, log, or trap information is displayed. This function is enabled by default. After a synchronous output is disabled, this function is still supported.
    When a command is being run, no debugging, log, or trap information is displayed. After the command is run, debugging, log, or trap information is displayed.
    When you enter Y for the message "Are you sure to continue?[Y/N]," the [Y/N]: prompt is displayed after debugging, log, or trap information is displayed.
    When you enter the More phase, the More prompt is displayed after debugging, log, or trap information is displayed.

    If you run a command, for example, for decompressing or saving a file, the terminal does not display output information until the operation is complete. This process ensures monitoring continuity.

Prerequisites

    Terminal display has been enabled using the terminal monitor command.
