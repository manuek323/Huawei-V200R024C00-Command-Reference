6.9 Configuring an OSPFv3 NSSA
Applicable Environment
Configure a non-backbone area on the border of an AS as a not-so-stubby area
(NSSA) to reduce entries in routing tables and the amount of routing information
transmitted. An NSSA allows the transmission of Type 7 LSAs, which are generated
by ASBRs in an NSSA. These LSAs are converted into Type 5 LSAs in the NSSA and
advertised to other areas.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring an OSPFv3 NSSA, configure basic OSPFv3 functions.

6.11 Controlling OSPFv3 Routing Information
Applicable Environment
Control the advertisement and receipt of OSPFv3 routing information and
configure OSPFv3 to import external routes. Detailed operations include
configuring route summarization, filtering the received routes, and importing
external routes.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before controlling OSPFv3 routing information, configure basic OSPFv3
functions.
6.11.1 Configuring OSPFv3 Route Summarization
Context
Route summarization on a large-scale OSPFv3 network reduces the number of
routing entries. This function minimizes system resource consumption while
maintaining system performance. In addition, if a link in the summarized IPv6
address segment frequently alternates between Up and Down, the devices outside
this address segment will not be affected by the link status transition. Route
summarization therefore prevents route flapping and improves network stability.

6.11.2 Configuring OSPFv3 to Filter the Received Routes
Context
Configuring a filtering policy allows OSPFv3 to determine whether to add the
calculated routes to the local routing table when receiving LSAs.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 [
process-id ]
The OSPFv3 view is displayed.

OSPFv3 is configured to filter the imported routes.
Using the filter-policy command, you can only filter the routes calculated by
OSPFv3. Routes that do not pass the filtering criteria are neither added to the
OSPFv3 routing table nor advertised.
----End
6.11.3 Configuring OSPFv3 to Import External Routes
Context
Because OSPFv3 is a link-state routing protocol and cannot filter advertised LSAs
directly, it must filter routes when importing them. After filtering, only the routes
that pass the filtering criteria are advertised.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 [
process-id ]
The OSPFv3 view is displayed.
Step 3 Run default { cost

External routes are imported.
NOTE
Importing IBGP routes in an OSPFv3 process may lead to routing loops.
After the import-route command is executed on an OSPFv3 switch to import external
routes, the switch becomes an ASBR.
Step 5 (Optional) Run default-route-advertise [ always | cost
cost | type
type | tag
tag |
route-policy
route-policy-name ]*
Default routes are advertised to the OSPFv3 routing area.
Step 6 (Optional) Run filter-policy {
acl6-number | acl6-name
acl6-name | ipv6-prefix
ipv6-prefix-name | route-policy
route-policy-name } export [
protocol [
process-
id ] ]
Imported external routes are filtered.
To filter a certain type of route, you must specify
protocol. Otherwise, OSPFv3
filters all imported routes.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 420
NOTE
The filter-policy command takes effect only for the routes imported by an ASBR using the
import-route command. The ASBR filters routes when importing the routes. The routes
that are filtered out do not generate LSAs and cannot be advertised by OSPFv3. If the
import-route command is not run to import other external routes (including OSPFv3
routes in different processes), the filter-policy command does not take effect.
----End
6.11.4 (Optional) Configuring OSPFv3 to Filter LSAs in an
Area
Context
After filtering criteria are set for the incoming or outgoing Type 3 LSAs (Inter-
Area-Prefix LSAs) in an area, only the Type 3 LSAs that meet the criteria are
received or advertised. This filters unnecessary LSAs, reduces the LSDB size, and
increases network convergence.
This function is applicable only to the ABR.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 [
process-id ]
The OSPFv3 process view is displayed.
Step 3 Run area

6.12 Optimizing an OSPFv3 Network
Applicable Environment
Adjust the OSPFv3 timer to change the convergence speed of an OSPFv3 network
and the network overload caused by protocol packets. On low-speed links, take
into account the delay in transmitting LSAs on the interface. Adjust the SPF
calculation interval to mitigate resource consumption caused by frequent network
changes.
Specify the DR priority of an interface to affect DR and BDR election in a
broadcast network.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before optimizing an OSPFv3 network, configure basic OSPFv3 functions.
6.12.1 Configuring an SPF Timer
Context
When the OSPFv3 LSDB changes, SPF calculation must be performed again. A
shorter SPF calculation interval can increase network convergence speed, but also
occupies more resources. In addition, frequent network changes can cause
excessive bandwidth use. A longer SPF calculation interval occupies fewer
resources, which prevents the bandwidth use due to frequent network changes.
However, this also decreases network convergence speed. Set the interval based
on actual network conditions.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.

6.12.2 Suppressing an Interface from Sending and Receiving
OSPFv3 Packets
Context
To prevent a switch from advertising routes to the switch on a certain network
and from importing the routes of other switches, suppress the interface on which
OSPFv3 is enabled from receiving and sending OSPFv3 packets.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 [
process-id ]
The OSPFv3 view is displayed.

Step 3 Run silent-interface { all |
interface-type interface-number }
The interface is suppressed from sending and receiving OSPFv3 packets.
----End
Follow-up Procedure
Different processes can suppress the same interface from sending and receiving
OSPFv3 packets, but the silent-interface command is valid only for the OSPFv3
interface on which the specified process is enabled. It does not take effect on the
interface of other processes.
After an OSPFv3 interface is set to silent, the interface can still advertise its direct
routes using the Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA of the same switch. No OSPFv3 neighbor
relationship can be set up on the interface. This enhances OSPFv3 adaptability.
6.12.3 Configuring a DR Priority for an Interface
Context
The DR priority on a switch interface determines whether the interface is qualified
for the DR election. If the DR priority is 0, the switch cannot be elected as a DR or
BDR.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
Step 3 (Optional) On an Ethernet interface, run undo portswitch
The interface is switched to Layer 3 mode.
By default, an Ethernet interface works in Layer 2 mode.
NOTE
Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H,
S6730-S, and S6730S-S support switching between Layer 2 and Layer 3 modes.
Step 4 Run ospfv3 dr-priority

Follow-up Procedure
After the DR priority is changed, you can re-elect a DR or BDR. However, this will
interrupt OSPFv3 neighbor relationships between switches and is therefore only
used when necessary. The methods to re-elect a DR or BDR are as follows:
● Restart all switches.
● Run the shutdown and undo shutdown commands on the interface on
which the OSPFv3 neighbor relationship is set up.
6.12.4 Configuring a Stub Router
Context
A stub router is used to control traffic and instructs other OSPFv3 routers not to
use it to forward data. Other OSPFv3 routers can have a route to the stub router.

BFD detects links much faster than keepalive protocols do. If OSPFv3 is bound to
BFD sessions, BFD can notify OSPFv3 of link failures immediately. OSPFv3 then
performs route calculation and convergence based on the new network topology.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring BFD for OSPFv3, configure basic OSPFv3 functions.

OSPFv3 process.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3

OSPFv3 BFD parameters are configured.
Using the default
min-transmit-value,
min-receive-value, and detect-multiplier
values is recommended. As such, this step can be skipped.
The parameters are configured based on the network status and network
reliability requirements. A short interval at which BFD packets are transmitted can
be configured for a link that has a higher requirement for reliability. A long
interval at which BFD packets are transmitted can be configured for a link that has
a lower requirement for reliability.
----End
6.13.3 (Optional) Preventing an Interface from Dynamically
Setting Up a BFD Session
Context
After the bfd all-interfaces enable command is run in an OSPFv3 process, the
following situations occur:
● On a P2P network, all OSPFv3 interfaces whose neighbor status is Up set up
dynamic BFD sessions.
● On a broadcast network, all OSPFv3 interfaces whose neighbor status is Up
set up dynamic sessions between DRs and non-DRs.
To prevent certain interfaces from setting up dynamic BFD sessions, perform the
following steps on the interfaces:

6.13.4 (Optional) Configuring BFD for a Specified Interface
Context
To configure BFD only on a specified interface or enable an interface to detect link
failures faster after BFD for OSPFv3 is enabled globally, perform the following
steps on the interface:
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run interface

The interface view is displayed.
Step 3 (Optional) On an Ethernet interface, run undo portswitch
The interface is switched to Layer 3 mode.

S6730-S, and S6730S-S support switching between Layer 2 and Layer 3 modes.
Step 4 Run ospfv3 bfd enable
BFD is enabled on the interface to establish a BFD session.
When BFD is configured globally and the neighbor status is Full, OSPFv3
establishes BFD sessions on all the neighbors in the process using default BFD
parameters.
You can run the ospfv3 bfd { min-transmit-interval
min-transmit-value | min-
receive-interval
min-receive-value | detect-multiplier
detect-multiplier-value }*
[ instance

Using the default
min-transmit-value,

values is recommended. Therefore, the ospfv3 bfd { min-transmit-interval
min-
transmit-value | min-receive-interval
min-receive-value | detect-multiplier

The parameters are configured based on the network status and network
reliability requirements. A short interval at which BFD packets are transmitted can
be configured for a link that has a higher requirement for reliability. A long
interval at which BFD packets are transmitted can be configured for a link that has
a lower requirement for reliability.
NOTE
● The BFD configured on an interface takes precedence over that configured in a process.
Specifically, if BFD is enabled on an interface, BFD parameters on the interface are used
to establish BFD sessions.
● If the parameters of a BFD session are set but the ospfv3 bfd enable command is not
run, BFD cannot be enabled.

6.14 Configuring OSPFv3 IP FRR
Usage Scenario
With the development of networks, Voice over IP (VoIP) and on-line video services
require high-quality real-time transmission. Nevertheless, if an OSPFv3 fault
occurs, traffic can be switched to a new link only after the following processes:
fault detection at the millisecond level, notifying the fault to the routing control
plane at the millisecond level, generating and flooding new topology information
at the tens of milliseconds level, triggering SPF calculation at the tens of
milliseconds level, and notifying and installing a new route at the hundreds-of-
milliseconds level. As a result, it takes much more than 50 ms to recovery the link
from the fault, which cannot meet the requirement for real-time services on the
network.
With OSPFv3 IP FRR that calculates a backup link in advance, devices can fast
switch traffic to the backup link without interrupting traffic when the primary link
becomes faulty. This protects traffic and therefore greatly improves the reliability
of OSPFv3 networks.
OSPFv3 IP FRR is applicable to the services that are sensitive to packet delay and
packet loss.

6.14.1 Enabling OSPFv3 IP FRR
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 [

vpn-instance-name ]
An OSPFv3 process is started, and the OSPFv3 view is displayed.
Step 3 Run frr
The OSPFv3 IP FRR view is displayed.
Step 4 Run loop-free-alternate
OSPFv3 IP FRR is enabled to generate a loop-free backup link.
By default, this function is disabled. OSPFv3 can generate a loop-free backup link
only when the OSPFv3 IP FRR traffic protection inequality is met.
NOTE
In the following description, Distance_opt(X, Y) indicates the shortest link from node X to
node Y, S stands for a source node, E for the faulty node, N for a node along a backup link,
and D for a destination node.
● Link protection takes effect when the traffic to be protected flows along a
specified link and the link cost meets the inequality: Distance_opt(N, D) <
Distance_opt(N, S) + Distance_opt(S, D).
● Node-and-link protection takes effect when the traffic to be protected flows
along a specified link and passes through a specified node and the following
conditions are met:
– The link cost meets the inequality: Distance_opt(N, D) < Distance_opt(N,
S) + Distance_opt(S, D).
– The interface cost meets the inequality: Distance_opt(N, D) <
Distance_opt(N, E) + Distance_opt(E, D).
Step 5 (Optional) Run frr-policy route route-policy
route-policy-name
An OSPFv3 IP FRR filtering policy is configured.
After an OSPFv3 IP FRR filtering policy is configured, only the OSPFv3 backup
routes that pass the filtering criteria can be delivered to the forwarding table. To
protect the traffic over a specific OSPFv3 route, you can configure a filtering policy
that matches the OSPFv3 route to ensure that the route can be added to the
forwarding table. If this route fails, OSPFv3 can fast switch the traffic to a backup
route.

6.16 Improving OSPFv3 Network Security
Usage Scenario
If an OSPFv3 network requires high security, you can configure OSPFv3
generalized TTL security mechanism (GTSM) and an authentication mode to
improve network security.
● During network attacks, attackers may simulate OSPFv3 unicast packets and
continuously send them to the switch. If the packets are destined for the
switch, it directly forwards them to the control plane for processing without
validating them. As a result, the increased processing workload on the control
plane leads to high CPU usage. GTSM protects the switch against potential
attacks and improves system security by checking whether Hop Limit value in
each IP packet header is within a pre-defined range.
NOTE
OSPFv3 GTSM takes effect only on unicast packets and therefore applies to virtual
links and sham links.
● In OSPFv3 authentication, an authentication field is added to each OSPFv3
packet for encryption. When a local device receives an OSPFv3 packet from a
remote device, the local device discards the packet if the authentication
password carried in the packet is different from the local one, which protects
the local device against potential attacks. Therefore, OSPFv3 authentication
improves network security.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before improving OSPFv3 network security, complete the following tasks:
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 434
● Configure an IP address for each interface to ensure that neighboring routers
can use the IP addresses to communicate with each other.
● Configure basic OSPFv3 functions.
6.16.1 Configuring OSPFv3 GTSM
Context
GTSM only checks the TTL values of packets that match a GTSM policy. You can
configure a switch to allow mismatched packets to pass through the filter or be
discarded. If you configure the switch to discard mismatched packets, enable
GTSM on the switches with which the switch may communicate. Otherwise,
connections cannot be established, because the switch discards all packets from
non-GTSM switches.
In addition, you can configure the switch to log discarded packets. This facilitates
future fault locating.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 valid-ttl-hops
valid-ttl-hops-value [ vpn-instance
vpn-instance-
name ]
OSPFv3 GTSM is configured.
GTSM must be enabled at both ends of an OSPFv3 connection.
The ospfv3 valid-ttl-hops command both enables OSPFv3 GTSM and sets a TTL
value. If you specify the vpn-instance parameter, the switch sets only the TTL
values of packets in this VPN but does not enable OSPFv3. Therefore, if you want
to apply the configured TTL value only to packets in a VPN instance or a public
network instance, set the default action to pass for packets that does not match
the GTSM policy. This prevents OSPFv3 packets in other instances from being
discarded.
NOTE
The range of valid TTL value is from (255 –
valid-ttl-hops-value + 1) to 255.
Step 3 (Optional) Run gtsm default-action { drop | pass }
An action is configured for the switch to perform on the packets that do not
match the GTSM policy.
By default, pass is executed on these packets.
NOTE
If an action is configured but a GTSM policy is not, GTSM does not take effect.
Step 4 (Optional) Run gtsm log drop-packet all
The switch is configured to log the packets discarded on the switch.

6.16.2 Configuring an Authentication Mode
Context
OSPFv3 supports keychain and HMAC-SHA256 authentication modes. The
following procedure uses keychain authentication as an example.
Before you configure keychain authentication, run the keychain command to
configure a keychain, the key-id command to configure a key ID, the key-string
command to configure a password, and the algorithm command to configure an
algorithm. If these commands are not run, OSPFv3 authentication will fail.
NOTICE
If plain is selected during the authentication mode configuration, the password is
saved in the configuration file in plain text. This is a security risk. It is
recommended that you select cipher to save the password in cipher text.

6.17 Configuring OSPFv3 Neighbor Relationship
Flapping Suppression

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 437
Usage Scenario
If an interface carrying OSPFv3 services alternates between Up and Down, OSPFv3
neighbor relationship flapping occurs on the interface. During the flapping,
OSPFv3 frequently sends Hello packets to reestablish the neighbor relationship,
synchronizes LSDBs, and recalculates routes. In this process, a large number of
packets are exchanged, adversely affecting neighbor relationship stability, OSPFv3
services, and other OSPFv3-dependent services. OSPFv3 neighbor relationship
flapping suppression can address this problem by delaying OSPFv3 neighbor
relationship reestablishment or preventing service traffic from passing through
flapping links.
NOTE
The following steps are optional, choose them as required.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression, complete
the following tasks:
● Configure an IP address for each interface to ensure that neighboring routers
are reachable at the network layer.
● Configure basic OSPFv3 functions.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
By default, OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression is enabled globally.
To disable this function globally, run the suppress-flapping peer disable
command.
Step 2 Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
By default, OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression is enabled on all
interfaces in the same OSPFv3 process. To disable the function from one of the
interfaces, run the ospfv3 suppress-flapping peer disable command.
Step 3 Run ospfv3 suppress-flapping peer hold-down
interval [ instance
instance-id ]
The Hold-down mode is configured, and its duration is set.
OSPFv3 neighbor flapping suppression works in either Hold-down or Hold-max-
cost mode.
● Hold-down mode: In the case of frequent flooding and topology changes
during neighbor relationship establishment, interfaces prevent neighbor
relationship reestablishment during Hold-down suppression, which minimizes
LSDB synchronization attempts and packet exchanges.
● Hold-max-cost mode: If the traffic forwarding path changes frequently,
interfaces use 65535 as the cost of the flapping link during Hold-max-cost
suppression, which prevents traffic from passing through the flapping link.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 438
Flapping suppression can also work first in Hold-down mode and then in Hold-
max-cost mode.
By default, the Hold-max-cost mode takes effect.
To disable the Hold-max-cost mode, run the ospfv3 suppress-flapping peer hold-
max-cost disable [ instance
instance-id ] command.
Step 4 Run ospfv3 suppress-flapping peer { detecting-interval
detecting-interval |
threshold
threshold | resume-interval
resume-interval } * [ instance
instance-id ]
Detection parameters are configured for OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping
suppression.
Each OSPFv3 interface on which OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping
suppression is enabled starts a flapping counter. If the interval between two
successive neighbor status changes from Full to a non-Full state is shorter than
detecting-interval, a valid flapping_event is recorded, and the flapping_count is
incremented by 1. When the flapping_count reaches or exceeds
threshold, flapping
suppression takes effect. If the interval between two successive neighbor status
changes from Full to a non-Full state is longer than
resume-interval, the
flapping_count is reset.
NOTE
The value of
resume-interval must be greater than that of
detecting-interval.
By default, the detection interval of OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping
suppression is 3s, the suppression threshold is 30, and the interval for exiting from
suppression is 10s. Using the default detection parameters is recommended.
Step 5 Run quit
The system view is displayed.
Step 6 Run quit
The user view is displayed.
Step 7 Run reset ospfv3
process-id suppress-flapping peer [
interface-type interface-
number [ instance

Interfaces are forced to exit from OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping
suppression.
NOTE
Interfaces exit from flapping suppression in the following scenarios:
● The suppression timer expires.
● The corresponding OSPFv3 process is reset.
● An OSPFv3 neighbor is reset.
● OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression is disabled globally using the
suppress-flapping peer disable command in the OSPFv3 view.
● The reset ospfv3 suppress-flapping peer command is run.

6.18 Configuring OSPFv3 IPSec
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring OSPFv3 IPSec, configure basic OSPFv3 functions.
6.18.1 Configuring an IPSec Session for Encryption
Context
Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) can be configured to prevent data theft and
spoofing during data transmission in a network.
A security association (SA) must be established so that IPSec can protect
transmitted data. An SA is a unidirectional logical connection set up for security
purpose and specifies the elements used by two IPSec peers (two parties that use
the IPSec protocol to protect data transmitted between them). The elements of an
SA include the following:
● Security protocol
● Authentication or encryption algorithm supported by the security protocol
● Data encapsulation mode
● Security parameter index (SPI) of the SA
● Authentication key or encryption key of the SA

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 440
The first three elements are specified in an IPSec proposal. To configure IPSec
functions, first configure an IPSec proposal on the IPSec peers, and then configure
an SA.
Procedure
Step 1 Configure an IPSec proposal.
1. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
2. Run ipsec proposal
proposal-name
An IPSec proposal is created and the IPSec proposal view is displayed.
3. Run transform { ah | esp }
A security protocol is specified for the IPSec proposal.
By default, the security protocol used by an IPSec proposal is the
Encapsulation Security Protocol (ESP).
4. An authentication or encryption algorithm is configured.
– If AH is used, you can only configure the AH-specific authentication
algorithm because AH only authenticates packets.
Run the ah authentication-algorithm { sha1 | sha2-256 } command to
specify the authentication algorithm for the AH protocol.
By default, the AH protocol uses the Secure Hash Algorithm 2-256
(SHA2-256) authentication algorithm.
– When ESP is specified, ESP can encrypt/authenticate, or encrypt and
authenticate packets. Configure the ESP-specific authentication or
encryption algorithm.
▪ Run the esp authentication-algorithm { sha1 | sha2-256 }
command to specify the authentication algorithm for the ESP
protocol.
By default, the authentication algorithm SHA2-256 is used for ESP.
▪ Run the esp encryption-algorithm { 3des | aes [ 128 | 192 | 256 ] }
command to specify the encryption algorithm for the ESP protocol.
By default, the encryption algorithm Advanced Encryption
Standard-256 (AES-256) is used for ESP.
The SHA-1 and 3DES algorithm is not recommended because it cannot meet
your security defense requirements.
5. Run encapsulation-mode { transport | tunnel }
A data encapsulation mode is specified for the security protocol.
By default, the data encapsulation mode is tunnel.
NOTE
In transport mode, the packet encryption device and decryption device must be the

Return to the system view.
Step 2 Configure an IPSec SA.
1. Run ipsec sa
sa-name
An IPSec SA is created and the IPSec SA view is displayed.
By default, no IPSec SA exists in the system.
2. Run proposal
proposal-name
The IPSec proposal is bound to the IPSec SA.
By default, an IPSec policy does not reference any IPSec proposal.
NOTE
An IPSec can use only one IPSec proposal. To bind a new IPSec proposal to the IPSec
SA, delete the original IPSec proposal.
3. Run sa spi { inbound | outbound } { ah | esp }
spi-number
An SPI is configured for the SA.
NOTE
– An SPI uniquely identifies an SA. Each SA must be configured with an inbound SPI
and an outbound SPI. The outbound SPI on the local end must be the same as the
inbound SPI on the remote end.
– The security protocol (AH or ESP) you select when configuring the SPI must be the
same as that used in the IPSec proposal bound to the SA.
4. Configure a key according to the security protocol used in the IPSec proposal
bound to the SA.
– If the AH protocol is used, you can configure an authentication key that is
a hexadecimal number or a character string.
▪ Run the sa authentication-hex { inbound | outbound } ah
[ cipher ]
hex-cipher-key command to configure a hexadecimal
authentication key.
▪ Run the sa string-key { inbound | outbound } ah [ cipher ]
string-
cipher-key command to configure a character string as the
authentication key.
– If the ESP protocol is used, you can run one of the following commands
to configure the authentication key or the encryption key. You can also
configure both the authentication key and encryption key. If the two keys
are configured at the same time, they can only be hexadecimal keys.
▪ Run the sa authentication-hex { inbound | outbound } esp
[ cipher ]
hex-cipher-key command to configure a hexadecimal
authentication key.
▪ Run the sa string-key { inbound | outbound } esp [ cipher ]
string-
cipher-key command to configure a character string as the
authentication key.
▪ Run the sa encryption-hex { inbound | outbound } esp [ cipher ]
hex-cipher-key command to configure a hexadecimal encryption key.

NOTE
– The security protocol (AH or ESP) you select when configuring the key must be the
same as that used in the IPSec proposal bound to the SA.
– The outbound key on the local end must be the same as the inbound key on the
remote end.
– The IPSec peers must use the authentication or encryption key in the same format.
For example, if the key on one end is a character string but the key on the other
end is a hexadecimal number, the IPSec tunnel cannot be set up.
– If you configure multiple keys in different formats, the last configured key takes
effect.
Step 3 Verify the configuration.
1. Run the display ipsec sa [ name
sa-name ] [ brief ] command to check
information about the SA.
2. Run the display ipsec proposal [ name
proposal-name ] command to check
information about the security proposal.
3. Run the display ipsec statistics [ sa-name
sa-name slot

an OSPFv3 external network. The OSPFv3 routing table size of SwitchC needs to
be reduced without affecting communication.
Figure 6-12 Networking diagram for configuring an OSPFv3 area
Configuration Roadmap
1. Create VLANs, add interfaces to the VLANs, and assign IPv6 addresses to
VLANIF interfaces so that neighboring devices can communicate with each
other.
2. Configure basic OSPFv3 functions on SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC to ensure
that there are reachable routes between OSPFv3 devices.
3. Configure a static route to the external network on SwitchB and import the
route into the OSPFv3 routing table to ensure that there are reachable routes
from the OSPFv3 network to the external network.
4. Configure Area1 as a stub area to reduce the OSPFv3 routing table size of
SwitchC.
5. Configure Area1 as a totally stub area. That is, prohibit SwitchA (an ABR) in
Area1 from advertising Type3 LSAs within Area1, which minimizing the
OSPFv3 routing table size of SwitchC.

The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure IPv6 addresses for interfaces.
2. Configure a router ID for each switch, enable OSPFv3, and specify the
network segments.
3. Check the DR and BDR status of each switch when the default priority is used.
4. Set a DR priority for the interface on each switch and check whether the
switch has become the DR or BDR.

[SwitchD-Vlanif10] quit
Check the neighbor information of SwitchA. The command output shows that all
the neighbors have the same default priority 1 and that SwitchD functions as the
DR and SwitchC as the BDR.
NOTE
When two Switches have the same priority, the Switch that has a larger router ID is elected
as the DR. If the VLANIF interface of a Switch becomes the DR, the other broadcast
interfaces of this Switch have a high priority in the future DR election. This means that the
Switch still functions as the DR, and the DR cannot be preempted.

6.21.3 Example for Configuring an OSPFv3 Virtual Link
Networking Requirements
In Figure 6-14, OSPFv3 is enabled on all Switches, and the AS is divided into three
areas. SwitchB and SwitchC serve as ABRs to forward inter-area routes. Area 2 is
not directly connected to the Area 0, the backbone area. Area 1 is the area
between Area 0 and Area 2.
Configure a virtual link in Area 1 where SwitchB and SwitchC are located so that
SwitchA and SwitchD can communicate with each other.
Figure 6-14 Networking diagram for configuring an OSPFv3 virtual link
Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure IPv6 addresses for interfaces.
2. Enable basic OSPFv3 functions on each switch.
3. Configure a virtual link between SwitchB and SwitchC to connect the non-
backbone areas to the backbone area.
Procedure
Step 1 Add interfaces to VLANs.
# Configure SwitchA. Ensure that the configurations of SwitchB, SwitchC, and
SwitchD are the same as that of SwitchA.

6.21.4 Example for Configuring OSPFv3 GR
Networking Requirements
In Figure 6-15, SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC belong to the same OSPFv3 area.
They communicate with each other through the OSPFv3 protocol and are enabled
with GR.
When OSPFv3 adjacencies are set up between SwitchA, SwitchC, and SwitchB, the
three switches exchange routing information. If the OSPFv3 protocol restarts on
SwitchA, SwitchA synchronizes data with neighboring switches through GR.
Figure 6-15 Networking diagram for configuring OSPFv3 GR
Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure IPv6 addresses for interfaces.
2. Enable basic OSPFv3 functions on each switch.
3. Enable the OSPFv3 GR helper in the OSPFv3 view of SwitchB.
4. Enable the OSPFv3 GR in the OSPFv3 view of SwitchA.

6.21.5 Example for Configuring BFD for OSPFv3
Networking Requirements
In Figure 6-16, OSPFv3 is run among SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC. Service
traffic is forwarded along the primary link SwitchA→SwitchB. The link
SwitchA→SwitchC→SwitchB is used as a backup. Customers require that service
traffic be fast switched to the backup link if the primary link fails.
NOTE
In this scenario, ensure that all connected interfaces have STP disabled. If STP is enabled
and VLANIF interfaces of switches are used to construct a Layer 3 ring network, an
interface on the network will be blocked. As a result, Layer 3 services on the network
cannot run normally.

Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure basic OSPFv3 functions on each switch to make the primary link
transmit service traffic properly.
2. Configure OSPFv3 BFD so that traffic can be fast switched to the backup link
if the primary link fails.
Procedure
Step 1 Configure IPv6 addresses for interfaces of all switches.

7.1 Overview of IS-IS
Definition
Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) is an Interior Gateway
Protocol (IGP) that runs within an autonomous system (AS). IS-IS is also a link-
state routing protocol, using the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm to calculate
routes.
Purpose
IS-IS is a dynamic routing protocol initially designed by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) for its Connectionless Network Protocol
(CLNP).
To support IP routing, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) extended and
modified IS-IS in RFC 1195. This modification enables IS-IS to apply to TCP/IP and
OSI environments. This type of IS-IS is called Integrated IS-IS or Dual IS-IS.
NOTE
IS-IS stated in this document refers to Integrated IS-IS, unless otherwise stated.
In addition to IPv4 networks, IS-IS also applies to IPv6 networks to provide
accurate routing information for IPv6 packets. IS-IS has good scalability, supports
IPv6 network layer protocols, and is capable of discovering, generating, and
forwarding IPv6 routes.
7.2 Understanding IS-IS
7.2.1 Basic Concepts of IS-IS
IS-IS Topology Structure
Overall IS-IS Topology
IS-IS uses a two-level hierarchy (backbone area and non-backbone area) to
support large-scale routing networks. Generally, Level-1 routers are deployed in
non-backbone areas, whereas Level-2 and Level-1-2 routers are deployed in
backbone areas. Each non-backbone area connects to the backbone area through
a Level-1-2 router.
Figure 7-1 shows a network that runs IS-IS. The network is similar to an OSPF
network topology with multiple areas. The backbone area contains all the routers
in Area 1 and Level-1-2 routers in other areas.

Figure 7-1 IS-IS topology I
Figure 7-2 shows another type of IS-IS topology. In this topology, Level-2 routers
belong to different areas. All the physically contiguous Level-1-2 and Level-2
routers form the backbone area of IS-IS.
Figure 7-2 IS-IS topology II
The two types of topologies show the differences between IS-IS and OSPF:
● In IS-IS, each router belongs to only one area. In OSPF, different interfaces of
a router may belong to different areas.
● In IS-IS, no area is defined as the backbone area. In OSPF, Area 0 is defined as
the backbone area.
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 475
● In IS-IS, Level-1 and Level-2 routes are calculated using the SPF algorithm to
generate the shortest path tree (SPT). In OSPF, the SPF algorithm is used only
in the same area, and inter-area routes are forwarded by the backbone area.
IS-IS Router Types
● Level-1 router
A Level-1 router manages intra-area routing. It establishes neighbor
relationships with only the Level-1 and Level-1-2 routers in the same area and
maintains a Level-1 link state database (LSDB). The LSDB contains intra-area
routing information. A packet to a destination outside this area is forwarded
to the nearest Level-1-2 router.
● Level-2 router
A Level-2 router manages inter-area routing. It can establish neighbor
relationships with Level-2 or Level-1-2 routers in different areas and
maintains a Level-2 LSDB. The LSDB contains inter-area routing information.
All Level-2 routers form the backbone network of the routing domain. They
establish Level-2 neighbor relationships and are responsible for inter-area
communication. Level-2 routers in the routing domain must be physically
contiguous to ensure the continuity of the backbone network. Only Level-2
routers can exchange data packets or routing information with routers outside
the routing domain.
● Level-1-2 router
A router that belongs to both a Level-1 area and a Level-2 area is called a
Level-1-2 router. It can establish Level-1 neighbor relationships with Level-1
and Level-1-2 routers in the same area. It can also establish Level-2 neighbor
relationships with Level-2 and Level-1-2 routers in different areas. A Level-1
router must be connected to other areas through a Level-1-2 router.
A Level-1-2 router maintains two LSDBs: a Level-1 LSDB and a Level-2 LSDB.
The Level-1 LSDB saves for intra-area routing and the Level-2 LSDB saves for
inter-area routing.
IS-IS Network Types
IS-IS supports only two types of networks. In terms of physical links, IS-IS
networks can be classified into the following link types:
● Broadcast: such as Ethernet and Token-Ring
● Point-to-point: such as PPP and HDLC
NOTE
IS-IS cannot run on Point to MultiPoint (P2MP) networks.
DIS and Pseudonode
In a broadcast network, IS-IS needs to elect a Designated Intermediate System
(DIS) from all the routers. DISs are used to create and update pseudonodes and
generate link state protocol data units (LSPs) of pseudonodes to describe available
network devices.
The pseudonode is used to simulate a virtual node in the broadcast network and is
not an actual router. In IS-IS, a pseudonode is identified by the system ID of the
DIS and the 1-byte Circuit ID (its value is not 0).
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 476
Figure 7-3 Pseudonode
As shown in Figure 7-3, the use of pseudonodes simplifies the network topology
and shortens LSPs. When the network changes, the number of generated LSPs is
reduced, and the SPF consumes fewer resources.
Level-1 and Level-2 DISs are elected separately. You can configure different
priorities for DISs of different levels. The router with the highest priority is elected
as the DIS. If there are multiple routers with the same highest priority on a
broadcast network, the one with the highest MAC address is chosen. The DISs of
different levels can be the same router or different routers.
DIS election in IS-IS differs from designated router (DR) election in OSPF:
● On an IS-IS broadcast network, the router with priority 0 also takes part in
DIS election. In OSPF, the router with priority 0 does not take part in DR
election.
● In IS-IS, when a new router that meets the requirements of being a DIS
connects to a broadcast network, the router is elected as the new DIS, and
the previous pseudonode is deleted. This causes a new flooding of LSPs. In
OSPF, when a new router connects to a network, it is not immediately elected
as the DR even if it has the highest DR priority.
● On an IS-IS broadcast network, routers (including non-DIS routers) of the
same level on a network segment set up adjacencies. In OSPF, routers set up
adjacencies with only the DR and backup designated router (BDR).
NOTE
On an IS-IS broadcast network, although all the routers set up adjacencies with each other,
the LSDBs are synchronized by the DISs.
IS-IS Address Structure
The network service access point (NSAP) is an address defined by the OSI to
locate resources. Figure 7-4 shows the NSAP address structure. The NSAP is
composed of the initial domain part (IDP) and the domain specific part (DSP). The
lengths of the IDP and the DSP are variable. The maximum length of the NSAP is
20 bytes and its minimum length is 8 bytes.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 477
● The IDP is similar to the network ID in an IP address. It is defined by the ISO
and consists of the authority and format identifier (AFI) and the initial
domain identifier (IDI). The AFI indicates the address allocation authority and
address format, and the IDI identifies a domain.
● The DSP is similar to the subnet ID and host address in an IP address. The
DSP consists of the High Order DSP (HODSP), system ID, and NSAP Selector
(SEL). The HODSP is used to divide areas, the system ID identifies a host, and
the SEL indicates the service type.
Figure 7-4 IS-IS address structure
● Area Address
The IDP and the HODSP of the DSP identify a routing domain and the areas
in a routing domain. Therefore, the combination of the IDP and HODSP is
called an area address, which is similar to an area number in OSPF. The area
addresses of routers in the same Level-1 area must be the same, while the
area addresses of routers in the Level-2 area can be different.
In general, a router can be configured with only one area address. The area
address of all nodes in an area must be the same. In the implementation of a
device, an IS-IS process can be configured with a maximum of three area
addresses to support seamless combination, division, and transformation of
areas.
● System ID
A system ID uniquely identifies a host or a router in an area. In the device, the
fixed length of the system ID is 48 bits (6 bytes).
In actual applications, a router ID corresponds to a system ID. If a router takes
the IP address 192.168.1.1 of Loopback 0 as its router ID, its system ID used in
IS-IS can be obtained in the following way:
– Extend each part of IP address 192.168.1.1 to 3 bits and add 0 to the
front of any part that is shorter than 3 bits. Then the IP address is
extended as 192.168.001.001.
– Divide the extended address 192.168.001.001 into three parts, each of
which consists of four decimal digits. Then system ID 1921.6800.1001 is
obtained.
You can specify a system ID in many ways. You need to ensure that the
system ID uniquely identifies a host or a router.
● SEL
The role of an SEL is similar to that of the "protocol identifier" of IP. A
transport protocol matches an SEL. The SEL is always "00" in IP.

Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 478
A Network Entity Title (NET) indicates the network layer information of an IS
itself and consists of an area ID and a system ID. It does not contain the transport
layer information (SEL = 0). A NET can be regarded as a special NSAP. The length
of the NET field is the same as that of an NSAP. Its maximum length is 20 bytes
and its minimum length is 8 bytes. When configuring IS-IS on a router, you can
configure only a NET instead of an NSAP.
Assume that there is a NET: ab.cdef.1234.5678.9abc.00. In the NET, the area
address is ab.cdef, the system ID is 1234.5678.9abc, and the SEL is 00.
IS-IS PDU Types
IS-IS PDUs include Hello PDUs, link state PDUs (LSPs), and sequence number
PDUs (SNPs).
● Hello PDU
Hello packets, also called IS-IS Hello PDUs (IIH), are used to set up and
maintain neighbor relationships. Among them, Level-1 LAN IIHs apply to the
Level-1 routers on broadcast LANs; Level-2 LAN IIHs apply to the Level-2
routers on broadcast LANs; and P2P IIHs apply to non-broadcast networks.
Hello packets on different networks have different formats. Compared to a
LAN IIH, a P2P IIH does not have the Priority and LAN ID fields, but has a
Local Circuit ID field. The Priority field indicates the DIS priority on a
broadcast network, the LAN ID field indicates the system ID of the DIS and
pseudonode, and the Local Circuit ID indicates the local link ID.
● LSP
LSPs are used to exchange link-state information. There are two types of LSPs:
Level-1 and Level-2. Level-1 IS-IS transmits Level-1 LSPs; Level-2 IS-IS
transmits Level-2 LSPs; and Level-1-2 IS-IS can transmit both Level-1 and
Level-2 LSPs.
The meanings of major fields in an LSP are as follows:
– ATT field: When a Level-1-2 IS-IS transmits Level-1 LSPs in a Level-1 area,
Level-1 IS-IS in the area can communicate with devices in other areas
through the Level-1-2 IS-IS if the ATT bit is set in the Level-1 LSPs.
– OL field: indicates the LSDB overload.
LSPs with the overload bit are still flooded on the network, but these
LSPs are ignored during the calculation of the routes that pass through a
router in overload state. After the overload bit is set on a router, other
routers ignore the router when performing SPF calculation and consider
only the direct routes of the router.
– IS Type field: indicates the type of IS-IS that generates the LSP. The value
01 indicates Level-1, and the value 11 indicates Level-2.
● SNP
SNPs describe the LSPs in all or some databases to help synchronize and
maintain all LSDBs.
SNPs include complete SNPs (CSNPs) and partial SNPs (PSNPs). They are
further classified into Level-1 CSNPs, Level-2 CSNPs, Level-1 PSNPs, and
Level-2 PSNPs.
A CSNP contains the summary of all LSPs in an LSDB. This maintains LSDB
synchronization between neighboring routers. On a broadcast network, the

DIS periodically sends CSNPs. The default interval for sending CSNPs is 10
seconds. On a point-to-point link, CSNPs are sent only when the neighbor
relationship is established for the first time.
A PSNP lists only the sequence number of recently received LSPs. A PSNP can
acknowledge multiple LSPs at one time. If an LSDB is not updated, the PSNP
is also used to request a neighbor to send a new LSP.
The variable length fields in an IS-IS PDU are multiple type-length-values (TLVs).
Figure 7-5 shows the TLV format. A TLV is also called a code-length-value (CLV).

7.2.2 IS-IS Fundamentals
IS-IS is a link-state routing protocol. Each router generates an LSP that contains
link state information about all the IS-IS interfaces on the router. The router can
establish IS-IS neighbor relationships with neighboring devices and update its
LSDB to synchronize the local LSDB with the LSDBs of all the other devices on the
IS-IS network. Based on the local LSDB, the router uses the SPF algorithm to
calculate IS-IS routes. If the router finds that an IS-IS route is the optimal route to
a destination, the router adds the route to the local IP routing table to guide
packet forwarding.
Establishment of IS-IS Neighbor Relationship
Two IS-IS routers need to establish a neighbor relationship before exchanging
packets to implement routing. On different networks, the modes for establishing
IS-IS neighbors are different.
● Establishment of a neighbor relationship on a broadcast link
Figure 7-6 uses Level-2 routers as an example to describe the process of
establishing a neighbor relationship on a broadcast link. The process of
establishing a neighbor relationship between Level-1 routers is the same as
the process of establishing a neighbor relationship between Level-2 routers.
Figure 7-6 Process of establishing a neighbor relationship on a broadcast link
a. RouterA broadcasts a Level-2 LAN IS-IS Hello PDU (IIH) with no neighbor
ID specified.
b. RouterB receives this packet and sets the status of the neighbor
relationship with RouterA to Initial. RouterB then responds to RouterA
with a Level-2 LAN IIH, indicating that RouterA is a neighbor of RouterB.
c. RouterA receives this packet and sets the status of the neighbor
relationship with RouterB to Up. RouterA then sends RouterB a Level-2
LAN IIH indicating that RouterB is a neighbor of RouterA.

d. RouterB receives this packet and sets the status of the neighbor
relationship with RouterA to Up. RouterA and RouterB establish a
neighbor relationship successfully.
The network is a broadcast network, so a DIS needs to be elected. After the
neighbor relationship is established, routers wait for two intervals before
sending Hello packets to elect the DIS. The IIH packets exchanged by the
routers contain the Priority field. The router with the highest priority is elected
as the DIS. If the routers have the same priority, the router with the largest
interface MAC address is elected as the DIS.
● Establishment of a neighbor relationship on a P2P link
Unlike the establishment of a neighbor relationship on a broadcast link, the
establishment of a neighbor relationship on a P2P link is classified into two
modes: two-way mode and three-way mode.
– Two-way mode
Upon receiving a P2P IIH from a neighbor, a router considers the
neighbor Up and establishes a neighbor relationship with the neighbor.
– Three-way mode
A neighbor relationship is established after P2P IIHs are sent three times.
The establishment of a neighbor relationship on a P2P link is similar to
that on a broadcast link.
The two-way mode has distinct disadvantages. For example, when two or
more links exist between two routers, the two routers can still establish a
neighbor relationship if one link is Down and the other is Up in the same
direction. The parameters of the link in Up state are used in SPF calculation.
As a result, the router that does not detect the fault of the link in Down state
still tries to forward packets over this link. The three-way mode addresses
such problems on unreliable P2P links. In three-way mode, a router considers
the neighbor Up only after confirming that the neighbor receives the packet
sent by it, and then establishes a neighbor relationship with the neighbor.
Basic rules for establishing an IS-IS neighbor relationship are as follows:
● Only neighboring routers of the same level can set up the neighbor
relationship with each other.
● Level-1 routers must have the same area IDs.
● Network types of IS-IS interfaces on both ends of a link must be consistent.
NOTE
Ethernet interfaces can be simulated as P2P interfaces to establish a neighbor
relationship on a P2P link.
● IP addresses of IS-IS interfaces on both ends of a link must be on the same
network segment.
IS-IS runs on the data-link layer and was initially designed for CLNP.
Therefore, the establishment of IS-IS neighbor relationships is not related to
IP addresses. In the implementation of a device, IS-IS runs only over IP.
Therefore, IS-IS needs to check the IP address of its neighbor. If secondary IP
addresses are assigned to the interfaces, the routers can still set up the IS-IS
neighbor relationship, but only when either the primary IP addresses or
secondary IP addresses are on the same network segment.

NOTE
When IP addresses of IS-IS interfaces on both ends of a link are on different network
segments, a neighbor relationship can still be established on the two interfaces if the
interfaces are configured not to check the IP addresses in received Hello packets. You
can configure P2P interfaces not to check the IP addresses in received Hello packets.
Before configuring Ethernet interfaces not to check the IP addresses, simulate Ethernet
interfaces as P2P interfaces.
Process of Exchanging IS-IS LSPs
Causes of LSP generation
All routers in the IS-IS routing domain can generate LSPs. The following events
trigger the generation of a new LSP:
● Neighbor is Up or Down.
● Related interface goes Up or Down.
● Imported IP routes change.
● Inter-area IP routes change.
● Interface is assigned a new metric value.
● Periodic updates occur.
Processing of a new LSP received from a neighbor
1. The router installs the LSP to its LSDB and marks it for flooding.
2. The router sends the LSP to all interfaces except the interface that initially
received the LSP.
3. The neighbors flood the LSP to their neighbors.
LSP flooding
In LSP flooding, a router sends an LSP to its neighbors and then the neighbors
send the received LSP to their respective neighbors except the router that first
sends the LSP. In this manner, the LSP is flooded among the routers of the same
level. LSP flooding allows each router of the same level to have the same LSP
information and synchronize its LSDB with each other.
Each LSP has a 4-byte sequence number. When a router is started, the sequence
number of the first LSP sent by the router is 1. When a new LSP is generated, the
sequence number of the LSP is equal to the sequence number of the previous LSP
plus 1. Therefore, newer LSPs have larger sequence numbers.

broadcast link

Figure 7-7 Process of updating LSDBs on a broadcast link
In Figure 7-7
1. A new router (RouterC) sends a Hello packet to establish neighbor
relationships with the other routers in the broadcast domain.
2. RouterC establishes neighbor relationships with RouterA and RouterB, waits
for the timeout of the LSP refresh timer, and then sends its LSP to a multicast
address (01-80-C2-00-00-14 in a Level-1 area and 01-80-C2-00-00-15 in a
Level-2 area). All neighbors on the network can receive the LSP.
3. The DIS on the network segment adds the received LSP to its LSDB. After the
CSNP timer expires, the DIS sends CSNPs to synchronize the LSDBs on the
network.
4. RouterC receives the CSNPs from the DIS, checks its LSDB, and sends a PSNP
to request the LSPs it does not have.
5. The DIS receives the PSNP and sends RouterC the required LSPs for LSDB
synchronization.
The process of updating the LSDB of the DIS is as follows:
1. When the DIS receives an LSP, it searches the LSDB to check whether the
same LSP exists. If the DIS does not find the same LSP in its LSDB, the DIS
adds the LSP to its LSDB and broadcasts the content of the new LSDB.
2. If the sequence number of the received LSP is greater than that of the
corresponding LSP in the LSDB, the DIS replaces the existing LSP with the
received LSP and broadcasts the contents of the new LSDB. If the sequence
number of the received LSP is smaller than that of the corresponding LSP in
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches

the LSDB, the DIS sends its LSP in the LSDB through the inbound interface of
the received LSP.
3. If the sequence number of the received LSP is the same as that of the
corresponding LSP in the LSDB, the DIS compares the remaining lifetime of
the two LSPs. If the remaining lifetime of the received LSP is smaller than that
of the corresponding LSP in the LSDB, the DIS replaces the existing LSP with
the received LSP and broadcasts the contents of the new LSDB. If the
remaining lifetime of the received LSP is greater than that of the
corresponding LSP, the DIS sends its LSP in the LSDB through the inbound
interface of the received LSP.
4. If the sequence number and remaining lifetime of the received LSP are the
same as those of the corresponding LSP in the LSDB, the DIS compares the
checksum of the two LSPs. If the checksum of the received LSP is greater than
that of the corresponding LSP in the LSDB, the DIS replaces the existing LSP
with the received LSP and broadcasts the content of the new LSDB. If the
checksum of the received LSP is smaller than that of the corresponding LSP,
the DIS sends its LSP in the LSDB through the inbound interface of the
received LSP.
5. If the sequence number, remaining lifetime, and checksum of the received LSP
are the same as those of the corresponding LSP in the LSDB, the DIS does not
forward the received LSP.
Process of synchronizing the LSDB on a P2P link

1. RouterA establishes a neighbor relationship with RouterB.
2. RouterA and RouterB send a CSNP to each other. If the LSDB of the neighbor
and the received CSNP are not synchronized, the neighbor sends a PSNP to
request the required LSP.
3. Figure 7-8 assumes that RouterB requests the required LSP from RouterA.
RouterA sends the required LSP to RouterB, starts the LSP retransmission
timer, and waits for a PSNP from RouterB as an acknowledgement for the
received LSP.

4. If RouterA does not receive a PSNP from RouterB after the LSP retransmission
timer expires, RouterA resends the LSP until it receives a PSNP from RouterB.
NOTE
A PSNP on a P2P link is used as:
● A request packet to acquire LSPs
● An ACK packet to acknowledge the received LSP
The process of updating LSDBs on a P2P link is as follows:
1. If the sequence number of the received LSP is greater than the sequence
number of the corresponding LSP in the LSDB, the router adds the LSP to its
LSDB. The router then sends a PSNP packet to acknowledge the received LSP.
At last, the router sends the LSP to all its neighbors except the neighbor that
sends the LSP.
2. If the sequence number of the received LSP is smaller than the sequence
number of the corresponding LSP, the router directly sends its LSP to the
neighbor and waits for a PSNP from the neighbor as the acknowledgement.
3. If the sequence number of the received LSP is the same as the sequence
number of the corresponding LSP in the LSDB, the router compares the
Remaining Lifetime of the two LSPs. If the Remaining Lifetime of the received
LSP is 0, the router adds the LSP to its LSDB. The router then sends a PSNP to
acknowledge the received LSP, and sends the LSP to all its neighbors except
the neighbor that sends the LSP. If the Remaining Lifetime of the received LSP
is not 0 but the corresponding LSP in the LSDB is 0, the router directly sends
its local LSP to the neighbor and waits for a PSNP from the neighbor.
4. If the sequence number of the received LSP and the corresponding LSP in the
LSDB are the same, and neither Remaining Lifetime is 0, router compares the
checksum of the two LSPs. If the received LSP has a greater checksum than
that of the corresponding LSP, the router adds the LSP to its LSDB. The router
then sends a PSNP to acknowledge the received LSP, and sends the LSP to all
its neighbors except the neighbor that sends the LSP. If the received LSP has a
smaller checksum than that of the corresponding LSP, the router directly
sends its local LSP to the neighbor and waits for a PSNP from the neighbor.
5. If the checksum of the received LSP and that of the corresponding LSP are the
same, the LSP is not forwarded.
7.2.3 IS-IS Authentication
To ensure network security, IS-IS authentication encrypts IS-IS packets by adding
an authentication field to packets. When a local router receives IS-IS packets from
a remote router, the local router discards the packets if the authentication
passwords do not match. This protects the local router.
Authentication Types
Based on the types of packets, authentication is classified as follows:
● Interface authentication: authenticates Level-1 and Level-2 Hello packets sent
and received on IS-IS interfaces using the specified authentication mode and
password.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 486
NOTE
You can configure a router to perform interface authentication in the following ways:
● A router sends authentication packets carrying the authentication TLV and verifies
the authentication information about the received packets.
● A router sends authentication packets carrying the authentication TLV but does not
verify the authentication information about the received packets.
● Area authentication: authenticates Level-1 LSPs and Level-1 SNPs transmitted
in an IS-IS area using the specified authentication mode and password.
● Routing domain authentication: authenticates Level-2 LSPs and Level-2 SNPs
transmitted in an IS-IS routing domain using the specified authentication
mode and password.
NOTE
In area authentication and routing domain authentication, you can configure a router
to authenticate LSPs and SNPs separately in the following ways:
● A router sends LSPs and SNPs carrying the authentication TLV and verifies the
authentication information about the received LSPs and SNPs.
● A router sends LSPs carrying the authentication TLV and verifies the authentication
information about the received LSPs. The router sends SNPs carrying the
authentication TLV but does not verify the authentication information about the
received SNPs.
● A router sends LSPs carrying the authentication TLV and verifies the authentication
information about the received LSPs. The router sends SNPs without the
authentication TLV and does not verify the authentication information about the
received SNPs.
● A router sends LSPs and SNPs carrying the authentication TLV but does not verify
the authentication information about the received LSPs and SNPs.
Based on the authentication modes of packets, authentication is classified into the
following types:
● Plain text authentication: is a simple authentication mode in which passwords
are directly added to packets. This authentication is insecure.
● MD5 authentication: uses the MD5 algorithm to encrypt passwords before
they are added to packets, which improves password security.
● Keychain authentication: further improves network security with configurable
key chain that changes with time.
● HMAC-SHA256 authentication: uses the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm to encrypt
a password before adding the password to a packet, which ensures high
password security.
NOTE
Simple authentication and MD5 authentication have potential security risks. HMAC-SHA256
or Keychain authentication mode is recommended.
Mode in Which Authentication Information Is Carried
IS-IS provides a TLV to carry authentication information, with the type of the TLV
specified as 10.
● Type: is defined by the ISO as 10, with a length of 1 byte.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 487
● Length: indicates the length of the authentication TLV, which is 1 byte.
● Value: indicates the authentication contents of 1 to 254 bytes, including the
authentication type and password.
The authentication type is 1 byte:
– Type 0 is reserved.
– Type 1 indicates plain text authentication.
– Type 54 indicates MD5 authentication.
– Type 255 indicates routing domain private authentication methods.
7.2.4 IS-IS Route Leaking
Normally, Level-1 routers manage routes in Level-1 areas. All Level-2 and
Level-1-2 routers form a contiguous backbone area. Level-1 areas can only
connect to the backbone area and cannot connect to each other.
A Level-1-2 router encapsulates learned Level-1 routing information into a Level-2
LSP and floods the Level-2 LSP to other Level-2 and Level-1-2 routers. Then
Level-1-2 and Level-2 routers know routing information about the entire IS-IS
routing domain. To reduce the size of routing tables, a Level-1-2 router, by default,
does not advertise the learned routing information of other Level-1 areas and the
backbone area to its Level-1 area. In this case, Level-1 routers do not know
routing information outside the local area. As a result, Level-1 routers cannot
select the optimal route to a destination outside the local area.
IS-IS route leaking can solve this problem. You can configure access control lists
(ACLs) and routing policies and mark routes with tags on Level-1-2 routers to
select eligible routes. Then a Level-1-2 router can advertise routing information of
other Level-1 areas and backbone area to its Level-1 area.
Figure 7-9 IS-IS route leaking
In Figure 7-9, RouterA sends a packet to RouterF. The selected optimal route
should be RouterA->RouterB->RouterD->RouterE->RouterF. This is because the
cost of this route is 50, which is smaller than the cost (70) of the other route
(RouterA->RouterC->RouterE->RouterF). However, when you check the route on
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 488
RouterA to view the path of the packets sent to RouterF, the selected route is
RouterA->RouterC->RouterE->RouterF but not the optimal route from RouterA to
RouterF.
RouterA (Level-1 router) does not know routes outside its area, so it sends packets
outside its area through the default route generated by the nearest Level-1-2
router. Therefore, the optimal route is not used to forward the packets.
If route leaking is enabled on Level-1-2 routers (RouterC and RouterD), Level-1
routers in Area 10 can know routes outside Area 10 and passing through the two
Level-1-2 routers. After route calculation, the forwarding path becomes RouterA-
>RouterB->RouterD->RouterE->RouterF, which is the optimal route from RouterA
to RouterF.
7.2.5 IS-IS Overload
IS-IS Overload allows a device to use the IS-IS overload bit to identify the overload
state. The IS-IS overload bit is the OL field in an IS-IS LSP. After the overload bit is
set on a device, other devices ignore this device when performing SPF calculation
and consider only the direct routes of the device.
Figure 7-10 IS-IS Overload
As shown in Figure 7-10, RouterB forwards the packets sent from RouterA to
network segment 10.1.1.0/24. If the overload bit in the LSP sent from RouterB is
set to 1, RouterA considers the LSDB of RouterB incomplete and sends packets to
10.1.1.0/24 through RouterD and RouterE. This process does not affect the packets
sent to the directly connected network segment of RouterB.
If a device cannot store new LSPs and fails to synchronize the LSDB, the routes
calculated by this device are incorrect. In this situation, the device enters the
overload state and does not calculate the routes passing through this device;
however, the direct routes of the device are still valid.
A device may enter the overload state because of device abnormalities or is
manually configured to enter the overload state. When an IS-IS device on the
network needs to be upgraded or maintained, isolate this device from the network
temporarily and set the overload bit on the device to prevent other devices from
using this device to forward traffic.

NOTE
● If the system enters the overload state because of an abnormality, the system deletes all
the imported or leaked routes.
● If the system is configured to enter the overload state, the system determines whether
to delete all the imported or leaked routes based on the configuration.
7.2.6 IS-IS Network Convergence
Fast convergence and priority-based convergence can improve IS-IS network
convergence. Fast convergence speeds up network convergence by fast calculating
routes, while priority-based convergence sets different convergence priorities for
routes to improve network convergence.
Fast Convergence
IS-IS fast convergence is an extended feature of IS-IS that is implemented to speed
up the convergence of routes. Fast convergence includes the following:
● Incremental SPF (I-SPF): recalculates only the routes of the changed nodes
rather than all the nodes when the network topology changes. This speeds up
the calculation of routes.
In ISO 10589, the SPF algorithm is used to calculate routes. When a node
changes on the network, this algorithm is used to recalculate all routes. The
calculation takes a long time and consumes too many CPU resources,
affecting the convergence speed.
I-SPF improves this algorithm. Except for the first time, only changed nodes
instead of all nodes are involved in calculation. The shortest path tree (SPT)
generated is the same as that generated by the previous algorithm. This
decreases CPU usage and speeds up network convergence.
● Partial Route Calculation (PRC): calculates only the changed routes when the
routes on the network change.
Similar to I-SPF, PRC calculates only the changed routes, but it does not
calculate the shortest path. It updates routes based on the SPT calculated by
I-SPF.
In route calculation, a leaf represents a route, and a node represents a router.
If the SPT changes after I-SPF calculation, PRC processes all the leaves only on
the changed node. If the SPT remains unchanged, PRC processes only the
changed leaves. For example, if IS-IS is enabled on an interface of a node, the
SPT calculated by I-SPF remains unchanged. PRC updates only the routes of
this interface, consuming less CPU resources.
PRC working with I-SPF further improves the convergence performance of the
network. It is an improvement of the original SPF algorithm.
● Intelligent timer: applies to LSP generation and SPF calculation. The first
timeout period of the intelligent timer is fixed. Before the intelligent timer
expires, if an event that triggers the timer occurs, the next timeout period of
the intelligent timer increases.
Although the route calculation algorithm is improved, the long interval for
triggering route calculation affects the convergence speed. Frequent network
changes also consume too many CPU resources. The SPF intelligent timer
addresses both of these problems. In general, an IS-IS network is stable under
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 490
normal conditions. The probability of the occurrence of many network
changes is very minimal, and IS-IS does not calculate routes frequently. The
period for triggering the route calculation is very short (milliseconds). If the
topology of the network changes often, the intelligent timer increases the
route calculation interval to avoid too much CPU consumption. The original
mechanism uses a timer with uniform intervals, which makes fast
convergence and low CPU consumption impossible to achieve.
The LSP generation intelligent timer is similar to the SPF intelligent timer.
When the LSP generation intelligent timer expires, the system generates a
new LSP based on the current topology. The LSP generation timer is designed
as an intelligent timer to respond to emergencies (such as the interface is Up
or Down) quickly and speed up the network convergence.
● LSP fast flooding: speeds up the flooding of LSPs.
In most cases, when an IS-IS router receives new LSPs from other routers, it
updates the LSPs in its LSDB and periodically floods the updated LSPs
according to a timer.
LSP fast flooding speeds up LSDB synchronization because it allows a device
to flood fewer LSPs than the specified number before route calculation when
the device receives one or more new LSPs. This mechanism also speeds up
network convergence.
Priority-based Convergence
Priority-based IS-IS convergence ensures that specific routes are converged first
when a great number of routes need to be converged. You can assign a high
convergence priority to routes for key services so that these routes are converged
quickly. This reduces the impact of route convergence on key services. Different
routes can be set with different convergence priorities so that important routes
can be converged first. This improves network reliability.

IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping suppression works by delaying IS-IS neighbor
relationship reestablishment or setting the link cost to the maximum value
(16777214 in IS-IS wide mode and 63 in IS-IS narrow mode).
Background
If the status of an interface carrying IS-IS services alternates between Up and
Down, IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping occurs on the interface. During the
flapping, IS-IS frequently sends Hello packets to reestablish the neighbor
relationship, synchronizes LSDBs, and recalculates routes. In this process, a large
number of packets are exchanged, adversely affecting neighbor relationship
stability, IS-IS services, and other IS-IS-dependent services, such as LDP and BGP.
IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping suppression can address this problem by
delaying IS-IS neighbor relationship reestablishment or preventing service traffic
from passing through flapping links.

Related Concepts
Flapping_event: reported when the status of a neighbor relationship on an
interface last changes from Up to Init or Down. The flapping_event triggers
flapping detection.
Flapping_count: number of times flapping has occurred.
Detect-interval: interval at which flapping is detected. The interval is used to
determine whether to trigger a valid flapping_event.
Threshold: flapping suppression threshold. When the flapping_count reaches or
exceeds threshold, flapping suppression takes effect.
Resume-interval: interval used to determine whether flapping suppression exits. If
the interval between two valid flapping_events is longer than the resume-interval,
flapping suppression exits.
Implementation
Flapping detection
IS-IS interfaces start a flapping counter. If the interval between two
flapping_events is shorter than the detect-interval, a valid flapping_event is
recorded, and the flapping_count is incremented by 1. When the flapping_count
exceeds the threshold, the system determines that flapping occurs, and therefore
triggers flapping suppression, and sets the flapping_count to 0. If the interval
between two valid flapping_events is longer than the resume-interval before the
flapping_count reaches the threshold again, the system sets the flapping_count to
0 again. Interfaces start the suppression timer when the status of a neighbor
relationship last changes to Init or Down.
The detect-interval, threshold, and resume-interval are configurable.
Flapping suppression
Flapping suppression works in either Hold-down or Hold-max-cost mode.
● Hold-down mode: In the case of frequent flooding and topology changes
during neighbor relationship establishment, interfaces prevent neighbor
relationships from being reestablished during the suppression period, which
minimizes LSDB synchronization attempts and packet exchanges.
● Hold-max-cost mode: If the traffic forwarding path changes frequently,
interfaces use the maximum cost of the flapping link during the suppression
period, which prevents traffic from passing through the flapping link.
Flapping suppression can also work first in Hold-down mode and then in Hold-
max-cost mode.
By default, the Hold-max-cost mode takes effect. The mode and suppression
period can be changed manually.
NOTE
When an interface enters the flapping suppression state, all neighbor relationships on the
interface enter the state accordingly.

Interfaces exit from flapping suppression in the following scenarios:
● The suppression timer expires.
● The corresponding IS-IS process is reset.
● A command is run to exit from flapping suppression.
● Three Hello packets in which the padding TLV carries a sub-TLV with the value
being 251 are sent consecutively to notify the peer device to forcibly exit
flapping suppression.
Typical Scenarios
Basic scenario
In Figure 7-11, the traffic forwarding path is Device A -> Device B -> Device C ->
Device E before a link failure occurs. After the link between Device B and Device C
fails, the forwarding path switches to Device A -> Device B -> Device D -> Device
E. If the neighbor relationship between Device B and Device C frequently flaps at
the early stage of the path switchover, the forwarding path will be switched
frequently, causing traffic loss and affecting network stability. If the neighbor
relationship flapping meets suppression conditions, flapping suppression takes
effect.
● If flapping suppression works in Hold-down mode, the neighbor relationship
between Device B and Device C is prevented from being reestablished during
the suppression period, in which traffic is forwarded along the path Device A -
> Device B -> Device D -> Device E.
● If flapping suppression works in Hold-max-cost mode, the maximum cost is
used as the cost of the link between Device B and Device C during the
suppression period, and traffic is forwarded along the path Device A -> Device
B -> Device D -> Device E.
Figure 7-11 Flapping suppression in a basic scenario
Single-forwarding path scenario
When only one forwarding path exists on the network, the flapping of the
neighbor relationship between any two devices on the path will interrupt traffic

forwarding. In Figure 7-12, the traffic forwarding path is Device A -> Device B ->
Device C -> Device E. If the neighbor relationship between Device B and Device C
flaps, and the flapping meets suppression conditions, flapping suppression takes
effect. However, if the neighbor relationship between Device B and Device C is
prevented from being reestablished, the whole network will be divided. Therefore,
Hold-max-cost mode (rather than Hold-down mode) is recommended. If flapping
suppression works in Hold-max-cost mode, the maximum cost is used as the cost
of the link between Device B and Device C during the suppression period. After the
network stabilizes and the suppression timer expires, the link is restored.
NOTE
By default, the Hold-max-cost mode takes effect.
Figure 7-12 Flapping suppression in a single-forwarding path scenario
Broadcast scenario
In Figure 7-13, four devices are deployed on the same broadcast network using
switches, and the devices are broadcast network neighbors. If Device C flaps due
to a link failure, and Device A and Device B were deployed at different time
(Device A was deployed earlier for example) or the flapping suppression
parameters on Device A and Device B are different, Device A first detects the
flapping and suppresses Device C. Consequently, the Hello packets sent by Device
A do not carry Device C's router ID. However, Device B has not detected the
flapping yet and still considers Device C a valid node. As a result, the DIS
candidates identified by Device A are Device B and Device D, whereas the DIS
candidates identified by Device B are Device A, Device C, and Device D. Different
DIS candidates result in a different DIS election result, which may lead to route
calculation errors. To prevent this problem in scenarios where an interface has
multiple neighbors, such as on a broadcast, P2MP, or NBMA network, all
neighbors on the interface are suppressed when the status of a neighbor
relationship last changes to Init or Down. Specifically, if Device C flaps, Device A,
Device B, and Device D on the broadcast network are all suppressed. After the
network stabilizes and the suppression timer expires, Device A, Device B, and
Device D are restored to normal status.

Figure 7-13 Flapping suppression on a broadcast network
Scenario of multi-level networking
In Figure 7-14, Device A, Device B, Device C, Device E, and Device F are connected
on Level 1 (Area 1), and Device B, Device D, and Device E are connected on Level
2 (Area 0). Traffic from Device A to Device F is preferentially forwarded along an
intra-area route, and the forwarding path is Device A -> Device B -> Device C ->
Device E -> Device F. When the neighbor relationship between Device B and
Device C flaps and the flapping meets suppression conditions, flapping suppression
takes effect in the default mode (Hold-max-cost). Consequently, the maximum
cost is used as the cost of the link between Device B and Device C. However, the
forwarding path remains unchanged because intra-area routes take precedence
over inter-area routes during route selection according to IS-IS route selection
rules. To prevent traffic loss in multi-area scenarios, configure Hold-down mode to
prevent the neighbor relationship between Device B and Device C from being
reestablished during the suppression period. During this period, traffic is forwarded
along the path Device A -> Device B -> Device D -> Device E -> Device F.
NOTE
By default, the Hold-max-cost mode takes effect. The mode can be changed to Hold-down
manually.

Scenario with both LDP-IGP synchronization and IS-IS neighbor relationship
flapping suppression configured
In Figure 7-15, if the link between PE1 and P1 fails, an LDP LSP switchover is
implemented immediately, causing the original LDP LSP to be deleted before a
new LDP LSP is established. To prevent traffic loss, LDP-IGP synchronization needs
to be configured. With LDP-IGP synchronization, the maximum cost is used as the
cost of the new LSP to be established. After the new LSP is established, the
original cost takes effect. Consequently, the original LSP is deleted, and LDP traffic
is forwarded along the new LSP.
LDP-IGP synchronization and IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping suppression work
in either Hold-down or Hold-max-cost mode. If both functions are configured,
Hold-down mode takes precedence over Hold-max-cost mode, followed by the
configured link cost. Table 7-2 lists the suppression modes that take effect in
different situations.

preceding principles. No matter which mode (Hold-down or Hold-max-cost) is
selected, the forwarding path is PE1 -> P4 -> P3 -> PE2.

Figure 7-15 Scenario with both LDP-IGP synchronization and IS-IS neighbor
relationship flapping suppression configured
Scenario with both bit-error-triggered protection switching and IS-IS neighbor
relationship flapping suppression configured
If a link has poor link quality, services transmitted along it may be adversely
affected. If bit-error-triggered protection switching is configured and the bit error
rate (BER) along a link exceeds a specified value, a bit error event is reported, and
the maximum cost is used as the cost of the link, triggering route reselection.
Consequently, service traffic is switched to the backup link. If both bit-error-
triggered protection switching and IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping suppression
are configured, they both take effect. Hold-down mode takes precedence over
Hold-max-cost mode, followed by the configured link cost.
Scenario with both Link-bundle and IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping
suppression configured
When the service traffic rate exceeds the capacity of the link, multiple links must
be used. If one of the links between two devices is faulty, traffic is switched to
another link. Because of limited forwarding capacity on the new link, excessive
traffic is discarded. If the number of faulty links reaches the upper threshold, the
maximum cost is used as the cost of all links in the link bundle to switch all
service traffic to the backup nodes. When both link-bundle and neighbor
relationship flapping suppression are configured, if the number of flapping links
reaches the upper threshold, the maximum cost must be configured as the cost of
all other links in the link bundle to prevent service loss caused by user traffic
congestion. As shown in Figure 7-16, two parallel links exist between Device A
and Device C. If Link 1 is faulty and Link 2 bears all service traffic, traffic loss
occurs. If both link-bundle and neighbor relationship flapping suppression are
configured and Link 1 flaps, the maximum cost must be configured for Link 2 to
avoid service traffic congestion. Only the Hold-max-cost mode therefore can be
configured for neighbor relationship flapping suppression to switch the traffic
forwarding path to Device A->Device B->Device C.

7.2.8 IS-IS Administrative Tag
Administrative tags control the advertisement of IP prefixes in an IS-IS routing
domain to simplify route management. You can use administrative tags to control
the import of routes of different levels and different areas and control IS-IS multi-
instances running on the same router.

2. To ensure information security, it is required that other routers in Level-1 areas
(Areas 2, 3, and 5) should not receive the packets sent from RouterA. To meet this
requirement, configure the same administrative tag for IS-IS interfaces on RouterB,
RouterC, and RouterD and configure the Level-1-2 router in Area 4 to leak only
the routes matching the configured administrative tag from Level-2 to Level-1
areas. This allows RouterA to communicate with only RouterB, RouterC, and
RouterD when communicating with devices in Level-1 areas. Figure 7-18 shows
the topology formed on RouterA.
Figure 7-18 IS-IS administrative tag application
The value of an administrative tag is associated with certain attributes. If the cost-
style is wide, wide-compatible or compatible, when IS-IS advertises an IP address
prefix with these attributes, IS-IS adds the administrative tag to the TLV in the
prefix. The tag is flooded along with the prefix throughout the routing domain.
7.2.9 IS-IS Wide Metric
In ISO 10589, the maximum IS-IS interface metric value can only be 63 and the IS-
IS cost style is narrow. A small range of metrics cannot meet the requirements on
large-scale networks. Therefore, in RFC 3784, the maximum IS-IS interface metric
value can reach 16777215, and the maximum IS-IS route metric value can reach
4261412864; in this case, the IS-IS cost style is wide.
● The following lists the TLVs used in narrow mode:
– TLV 128 (IP Internal Reachability TLV): carries IS-IS routes in a routing
domain.
– TLV 130 (IP External Reachability TLV): carries IS-IS routes outside a
routing domain.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 499
– TLV 2 (IS Neighbors TLV): carries neighbor information.
● The following lists the TLVs used in wide mode:
– TLV 135 (Extended IP Reachability TLV): replaces the earlier IP
reachability TLV and carries IS-IS routing information. This TLV expands
the route metric and carries sub-TLVs.
– TLV 22 (IS Extended Neighbors TLV): carries neighbor information.
Table 7-3 lists the cost styles of received and sent IS-IS routing information. The
cost styles of received and sent IS-IS routing information vary according to the
cost style configured on a device.

NOTE
When the cost-style is set to compatible, IS-IS sends the information in narrow mode and in
wide mode respectively.
IS-IS in wide mode and IS-IS in narrow mode cannot communicate. If IS-IS in wide mode
and IS-IS in narrow mode need to communicate, you must change the mode to enable all
routers on the network to receive packets sent by other routers.
7.2.10 IS-IS LSP Fragment Extension
When an IS-IS router needs to advertise the LSPs that contain much information,
the IS-IS router generates multiple LSP fragments to carry more IS-IS information.
IS-IS LSP fragments are identified by the LSP Number field in their LSP IDs. This
field is of 1 byte. An IS-IS process can generate a maximum of 256 LSP fragments;
therefore, only a limited number of routes can be carried.
As defined in RFC 3786, virtual system IDs can be configured and virtual LSPs that
carry routing information can be generated for IS-IS.
Concepts
● Originating system: is a router that runs the IS-IS protocol. A single IS-IS
process can function as multiple virtual routers to advertise LSPs, and the
originating system refers to the IS-IS process.
● Normal System-ID: is the system ID of the originating system.
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 500
● Virtual System: is the system identified by the additional system ID to
generate extended LSP fragments. These fragments carry additional system
IDs in their LSP IDs.
● Additional System-ID: is assigned by network administrators to identify a
virtual system. A maximum of 256 extended LSP fragments can be generated
for each additional system ID.
NOTE
Like a normal system ID, an additional system ID must be unique in a routing domain.
● TLV 24 (IS Alias ID TLV): describes the relationship between the originating
system and virtual system.
Principles
In IS-IS, each system ID identifies a system, which can generate a maximum of
256 LSP fragments. With more additional system IDs (up to 50 virtual systems can
be configured), an IS-IS process can generate a maximum of 13,056 LSP
fragments.
After LSP fragment extension is configured, the system prompts you to restart the
IS-IS process if information is lost because LSPs overflow. After being restarted, the
originating system loads as much routing information to LSPs, adds the
overloaded information to the LSPs of the virtual system for transmission, and
uses TLV 24 to notify other routers of its relationship with the virtual system.
Operating Modes
An IS-IS router can run the LSP fragment extension feature in two modes.

7.2.11 IS-IS Host Name Mapping
The IS-IS host name mapping mechanism maps host names to system IDs for IS-IS
devices, including dynamic host name mapping and static host name mapping.
Dynamic host name mapping takes precedence over static host name mapping.
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 503
When both a dynamic host name and a static host name are configured, the
dynamic host name takes effect.
On an IS-IS router where host name exchange is disabled, information about IS-IS
neighbors and LSDBs shows that each device in an IS-IS routing domain is
identified by a system ID with 12-digit hexadecimal number, for example,
aaaa.eeee.1234. This device identification method is complex and not easy to use.
The host name exchange mechanism facilitates IS-IS network management and
maintenance.
The system ID is replaced by a host name in the following situations:
● When an IS-IS neighbor is displayed, the system ID of the IS-IS neighbor is
replaced by its host name. When the neighbor is the DIS, the system ID of the
DIS is also replaced by its host name.
● When an LSP in the IS-IS LSDB is displayed, the system ID in the LSP ID is
replaced by the host name of the IS-IS device that advertises the LSP.
● When details about the IS-IS LSDB are displayed, the Host Name field is
added to the LSP generated by the device where dynamic host name
exchange is enabled, and the system ID in the Host Name field is replaced by
the dynamic host name of the device that generates the LSP.
Dynamic Host Name Mapping
On a device where dynamic host name mapping is enabled, dynamic host name
information is advertised as TLV 137 (Dynamic Hostname TLV) in LSPs. When you
run IS-IS commands on other devices to view IS-IS information, the system ID of
the local device is replaced by the configured host name. The host name is easier
to identify and memorize than the system ID.
The Dynamic Hostname TLV is optional and can be inserted anywhere in an LSP.
The value of this TLV cannot be empty. A device can determine whether to send
LSPs carrying TLV 137, while the device that receives LSPs can determine whether
to ignore TLV 137 or whether to obtain TLV 137 for its mapping table.
Static Host Name Mapping
Static host name mapping allows you to configure the mapping between host
names and system IDs of other IS-IS devices on a device. Static host name
mapping takes effect only on the local device and is not advertised using LSPs.
7.2.12 IS-IS GR
IS-IS graceful restart (GR) is a high availability technology that implements non-
stop data forwarding.
After the master/slave switchover, no neighbor information is stored on the
restarted router. The first Hello packets sent by the router after restart do not
contain the neighbor list. After receiving the Hello packets, the neighbor checks
the two-way neighbor relationship and detects that it is not in the neighbor list of
the Hello packets sent by the router. The neighbor relationship is interrupted. The
neighbor then generates new LSPs and floods the topology changes to all other
routers in the area. Routers in the area calculate routes based on the new LSDBs,
which leads to route interruption or routing loops.

The IETF defined the GR standard, RFC 3847, for IS-IS. The restart of the protocol
is processed for both the reserved FIB tables and unreserved FIB tables. Therefore,
the route flapping and interruption of the traffic forwarding caused by the restart
can be avoided.
Concepts
IS-IS GR involves two roles, namely, GR restarter and GR helper.
● GR restarter: is a device that has the GR capability and restarts in GR mode.
● GR helper: is a device that has the GR capability and helps the GR restarter
complete the GR process. The GR restarter must have the GR helper
capability.
To implement GR, IS-IS uses TLV 211 (restart TLV) and three timers, T1, T2, and
T3.
Restart TLV
The restart TLV is an extended part of an IS-to-IS Hello (IIH) PDU. All IIH packets
of the router that supports IS-IS GR contain the restart TLV. The restart TLV carries
the parameters for the protocol restart. Figure 7-20 shows the format of the
restart TLV.
Figure 7-20 Restart TLV
Table 7-4 describes the fields of the restart TLV.

RR 1 bit Restart request bit. A router sends an RR packet to
notify the neighbors of its restarting or starting and

adjacency and return CSNPs.

suppress the broadcast of their neighbor relationships
to prevent routing loops.
Remaining
Time
2 bytes Time during which the neighbor does not reset the
adjacency. The length of the field is 2 bytes. The time
is measured in seconds. When RA is reset, the value is
mandatory.
Timers
Three timers are introduced to enhance IS-IS GR: T1, T2, and T3.
● T1: If the GR restarter has already sent an IIH packet with RR being set but
does not receive any IIH packet that carries the restart TLV and the RA set
from the GR helper even after the T1 timer expires, the GR restarter resets the
T1 timer and continues to send the restart TLV. If the ACK packet is received
or the T1 timer expires three times, the T1 timer is deleted. The default value
of a T1 timer is 3 seconds.
Any interface enabled with IS-IS GR maintains a T1 timer. On a Level-1-2
router, broadcast interfaces maintain a T1 timer for Level-1 and Level-2
neighbor relationships.
● T2: is the time from when the GR restarter restarts until the LSDBs of all
devices of the same level are synchronized. T2 is the maximum time that the
system waits for synchronization of all LSDBs. T2 is generally 60 seconds.
Level-1 and Level-2 LSDBs maintain their respective T2 timers.
● T3: is the maximum time during which the GR restarter performs GR. The T3
initial value is 65535 seconds. After the IIH packets that carry the RA are
received from neighbors, the T3 value becomes the smallest value among the
Remaining Time fields of the IIH packets. If the T3 timer expires, GR fails.
The entire system maintains a T3 timer.
Session Mechanism
For differentiation, GR triggered by the master/slave switchover or the restart of
an IS-IS process is referred to as restarting. In restarting, the FIB table remains
unchanged. GR triggered by router restart is referred to as starting. In starting, the
FIB table is updated.
The following describes the process of IS-IS GR in restarting and starting modes:
● Figure 7-21 shows the process of IS-IS restarting.

Figure 7-21 IS-IS restarting
a. After performing the protocol restart, the GR restarter performs the
following actions:
▪ Starts T1, T2, and T3 timers.
▪ Sends IIH packets that contain the restart TLV from all interfaces. In
such a packet, RR is set to 1, and RA and SA are set to 0.
b. After receiving an IIH packet, the GR helper performs the following
actions:
▪ Maintains the neighbor relationship and refreshes the current
Holdtime.
▪ Replies with an IIH packet containing the restart TLV. In the packet,
RR is set to 0; RA is set to 1, and the value of the Remaining Time
field indicates the period from the current moment to the timeout of
the Holdtime.
▪ Sends CSNPs and all LSPs to the GR restarter.
NOTE
On a P2P link, a neighbor must send CSNPs.
On a multicast link, only the neighbor of the DIS sends CSNPs. If the DIS is
restarted, a temporary DIS is elected from the other routers on the LAN.
If the neighbor does not have the GR helper capability, it ignores the
restart TLV and resets the adjacency with the GR restarter according to
normal IS-IS processing.

c. After the GR restarter receives the IIH response packet, in which RR is set
to 0 and RA is set to 1, from the neighbor, it performs the following
actions:
▪ Compares the current value of the T3 timer with the value of the
Remaining Time field in the packet. The smaller value is taken as the
value of the T3 timer.
▪ Deletes the T1 timer maintained by the interface that receives the
ACK packet and CSNPs.
▪ If the interface does not receive the ACK packet or CSNPs, the GR
restarter constantly resets the T1 timer and resends the IIH packet
that contains the restart TLV. If the number of timeouts of the T1
timer exceeds the threshold value, the GR restarter forcibly deletes
the T1 timer and turns to the normal IS-IS processing to complete
LSDB synchronization.
d. After the GR restarter deletes the T1 timers on all interfaces, the
synchronization with all neighbors is complete when the CSNP list is
cleared and all LSPs are collected. The T2 timer is then deleted.
e. After the T2 timer is deleted, the LSDB of the level is synchronized.
▪ In the case of a Level-1 or Level-2 router, SPF calculation is triggered.
▪ In the case of a Level-1-2 router, determine whether the T2 timer on
the router of the other level is also deleted. If both T2 timers are
deleted, SPF calculation is triggered. Otherwise, the router waits for
the T2 timer of the other level to expire.
f. After all T2 timers are deleted, the GR restarter deletes the T3 timer and
updates the FIB table. The GR restarter re-generates the LSPs of each
level and floods them. During LSDB synchronization, the GR restarter
deletes the LSPs generated before restarting.
g. At this point, the IS-IS restarting of the GR restarter is complete.
● The starting device does not retain the FIB table. The starting device depends
on the neighbors, whose adjacency with itself is Up before it starts, to reset
their adjacency and suppress the neighbors from advertising their adjacency.
The IS-IS starting process is different from the IS-IS restarting process, as
shown in Figure 7-22.

Figure 7-22 IS-IS starting
a. After the GR restarter is started, it performs the following actions:
▪ Starts the T2 timer for the synchronization of LSDBs of each level.
▪ Sends IIH packets that contain the restart TLV from all interfaces.
If RR in the packet is set to 0, a router is started.
If SA in the packet is set to 1, the router requests its neighbor to
suppress the advertisement of their adjacency before the neighbor
receives the IIH packet in which SA is set to 0.
b. After the neighbor receives the IIH packet that carries the restart TLV, it
performs the following actions depending on whether GR is supported:
▪ GR is supported.
Re-initiates the adjacency.
Deletes the description of the adjacency with the GR restarter from
the sent LSP. The neighbor also ignores the link connected to the GR
restarter when performing SPF calculation until it receives an IIH
packet in which SA is set to 0.
▪ GR is not supported.
Ignores the restart TLV and resets the adjacency with the GR
restarter.

Replies with an IIH packet that does not contain the restart TLV. The
neighbor then returns to normal IS-IS processing. In this case, the
neighbor does not suppress the advertisement of the adjacency with
the GR restarter. On a P2P link, the neighbor also sends a CSNP.
c. After the adjacency is re-initiated, the GR restarter re-establishes the
adjacency with the neighbors on each interface. When an adjacency set
on an interface is in the Up state, the GR restarter starts the T1 timer for
the interface.
d. After the T1 timer expires, the GR restarter sends an IIH packet in which
both RR and SA are set to 1.
e. After the neighbor receives the IIH packet, it replies with an IIH packet, in
which RR is set to 0 and RA is set to 1, and sends a CSNP.
f. After the GR restarter receives the IIH ACK packet and CSNP from the
neighbor, it deletes the T1 timer.
If the GR restarter does not receive the IIH packet or CSNP, it constantly
resets the T1 timer and resends the IIH packet in which RR and SA are set
to 1. If the number of the timeouts of the T1 timer exceeds the threshold
value, the GR restarter forcibly deletes the T1 timer and turns to the
normal IS-IS processing to complete LSDB synchronization.
g. After receiving the CSNP from the helper, the GR restarter synchronizes
the LSDB.
h. After the LSDB of this level is synchronized, the T2 timer is deleted.
i. After all T2 timers are deleted, the SPF calculation is started and LSPs are
regenerated and flooded.
j. At this point, the IS-IS starting of the GR restarter is complete.
7.2.13 BFD for IS-IS
In IS-IS, the interval for sending Hello packets is 10s, and the holddown time for
keeping the neighbor relationship is three times the interval for sending Hello
packets. If a router does not receive a Hello packet from its neighbor within the
holddown time, the router deletes the corresponding neighbor relationship. This
indicates that the router detects neighbor faults in seconds. Second-level fault
detection, however, may result in heavy packet loss on high-speed networks.
Bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) provides light-load and millisecond-level
link fault detection to prevent heavy packet loss. BFD is not used to substitute the
Hello mechanism of IS-IS but helps IS-IS rapidly detect the faults on neighbors or
links and instructs IS-IS to recalculate routes for packet forwarding.
In Figure 7-23, basic IS-IS functions are configured on every router, and BFD for
IS-IS is enabled on RouterA and RouterB.

Figure 7-23 BFD for IS-IS
When a fault occurs on the primary link, BFD fast detects the fault and reports it
to IS-IS. IS-IS sets the neighbors of the interface on the faulty link to Down, which
triggers topology calculation, and updates LSPs so that neighbors such as RouterC
can receive the updated LSPs from RouterB. This process implements fast network
convergence.
Classification of BFD for IS-IS
BFD for IS-IS includes static BFD for IS-IS and dynamic BFD for IS-IS.

Principles Differences
Static
BFD for

BFD session parameters,
including local and remote
discriminators, are manually
configured using commands,
and the requests for
establishing BFD sessions are
manually delivered.
● Static BFD can be manually
controlled and is easy to deploy.
To save memory and ensure
reliability of key links, deploy
BFD on specified links.
● Establishing and deleting BFD
sessions need to be manually
triggered and lack flexibility.
Configuration errors may occur.
For example, if an incorrect local
or remote discriminator is
configured, a BFD session
cannot work properly.

Mode
Principles Differences
Dynamic
BFD for
IS-IS
BFD sessions are dynamically
created but not manually
configured. When detecting
faults, BFD informs IS-IS of
the faults through the routing
management (RM) module.
IS-IS then turns the neighbors
Down, rapidly advertises the
changed LSPs, and performs
incremental SPF. This
implements fast route
convergence.
Dynamic BFD is more flexible than
static BFD. In dynamic BFD, routing
protocols trigger the setup of BFD
sessions, preventing the
configuration errors caused by
manual configuration. Dynamic
BFD is easy to configure and
applies to the scenarios where BFD
needs to be configured on the
entire network.
NOTE
BFD uses local and remote discriminators to differentiate multiple BFD sessions between
the same pair of systems.
Because IS-IS establishes only single-hop neighbors, BFD for IS-IS detects only single-hop
links between IS-IS neighbors.
Establishment and Deletion of BFD Sessions
The RM module provides related services for association with the BFD module for
IS-IS. Through RM, IS-IS prompts BFD to set up or tear down BFD sessions by
sending notification messages. In addition, BFD events are transmitted to IS-IS
through RM.
Conditions for setting up a BFD session
● Basic IS-IS functions are configured on each router and IS-IS is enabled on the
interfaces of the routers.
● BFD is globally enabled on each router, and BFD is enabled on a specified
interface or process.
● BFD is enabled on interfaces or processes, and the neighbors are Up. A DIS
needs to be elected on a broadcast network.
Process of setting up a BFD session
● P2P network
After the conditions for setting up a BFD session are satisfied, IS-IS instructs
BFD through RM to directly set up a BFD session between neighbors.
● Broadcast network
After the conditions for establishing BFD sessions are met, and the DIS is
elected, IS-IS instructs BFD through RM to establish a BFD session between
the DIS and each router. No BFD session is established between non-DISs.

NOTE
On a broadcast network, routers (including non-DIS routers) of the same level on a
network segment can establish neighbor relationships. In the implementation of BFD
for IS-IS, however, BFD sessions are established only between a DIS and a non-DIS. On
a P2P network, BFD sessions are directly established between neighbors.
If a Level-1-2 neighbor relationship is set up between two routers on a link, IS-IS sets
up two BFD sessions for the Level-1 and Level-2 neighbors on a broadcast network,
but sets up only one BFD session on a P2P network.
Conditions for tearing down a BFD session
● P2P network
When a neighbor relationship that was set up on P2P interfaces by IS-IS is
down (that is, the neighbor relationship is not in the Up state) or when the IP
protocol type of a neighbor is deleted, IS-IS tears down the BFD session.
● Broadcast network
When a neighbor relationship that was set up on P2P interfaces by IS-IS is
torn down (that is, the neighbor relationship is not in the Up state), when the
IP protocol type of a neighbor is deleted, or when the DIS is re-elected, IS-IS
tears down the BFD session.
NOTE
After dynamic BFD is globally disabled in an IS-IS process, the BFD sessions on all the
interfaces in this IS-IS process are deleted.
IS-IS Responding to BFD Session Down Event
When detecting a link failure, BFD generates a Down event, and then notifies RM
of the event. RM then instructs IS-IS to delete the neighbor relationship. IS-IS
recalculates routes to speed up route convergence on the entire network.
When both the local router and its neighbor are Level-1-2 routers, they establish
two neighbors of different levels. Then IS-IS establishes two BFD sessions for the
Level-1 neighbor and Level-2 neighbor respectively. When BFD detects a link
failure, it generates a Down event and informs the RM module of the event. The
RM module then instructs IS-IS to delete the neighbor relationship of a specific
level.
7.2.14 IS-IS Auto FRR
With the development of networks, the Voice over IP (VoIP) and on-line video
services require high-quality real-time transmission. Nevertheless, if an IS-IS fault
occurs, multiple processes, including fault detection, LSP update, LSP flooding,
route calculation, and FIB entry delivery, must be performed to switch traffic to a
new link. This results in a lengthy traffic interruption, which cannot meet the
requirement for real-time services.
Complying with RFC 5286 (Basic Specification for IP Fast Reroute Loop-Free
Alternates), IS-IS Auto FRR protects traffic when links or nodes become faulty. IS-
IS Auto FRR allows the forwarding system to rapidly detect such faults and take
measures to restore services as soon as possible.
In most cases, you can bind BFD to IS-IS Auto FRR to ensure millisecond-level fault
recovery. When BFD detects a link fault on an interface, the BFD session goes

Down, triggering FRR on the interface. Subsequently, traffic is switched from the
faulty link to the backup link, which protects services.
Principles
IS-IS Auto FRR pre-computes a backup link by using the Loop-Free Alternate (LFA)
algorithm, and then adds the backup link and the primary link to the forwarding
table. In the case of an IS-IS network failure, IS-IS Auto FRR can fast switch traffic
to the backup link before routes on the control plane converge. This ensures
normal transmission of traffic and improves the reliability of the IS-IS network.
The backup link is calculated through the LFA algorithm. With the neighbor that
can provide the backup link being the root, the shortest path to the destination
node is calculated by a device through the SPF algorithm. Then, the loop-free
backup link is calculated according to the inequality defined in RFC 5286.
IS-IS Auto FRR can filter backup routes that need to be added to the IP routing
table. Only the backup routes matching the filtering policy are added to the IP
routing table. In this manner, users can flexibly control the addition of IS-IS
backup routes to the IP routing table.
Applications
IS-IS Auto FRR support traffic engineering (TE) links, including the following types:
● IP protecting TE
As shown in Figure 7-24, the TE tunnel has the smallest IS-IS cost among the
paths from RouterS to RouterD. Therefore, RouterS selects the TE tunnel as
the primary path to RouterD. The path RouterS->RouterN->RouterD has the
second smallest cost. According to the LFA algorithm, RouterS selects the path
RouterS->RouterN->RouterD as the backup path. The outbound interface of
the backup path is the interface that connects RouterS to RouterN.
NOTE
If the outbound interface of the backup link is the actual outbound interface of the TE
tunnel, IP protecting TE fails.

● TE protecting IP
As shown in Figure 7-25, the physical path RouterS-->RouterN-->RouterD has
the smallest IS-IS metric among the paths from RouterS to RouterD.
Therefore, RouterS prefers the path RouterS-->RouterN-->RouterD as the
primary path from RouterS to RouterD. The IS-IS cost of the TE tunnel is 12,
and the explicit path of the TE tunnel is the direct link from RouterS to
RouterD. The IS-IS metric of the direct link from RouterS to RouterD is 13,
which is greater than the IS-IS metric of the TE tunnel. Therefore, IS-IS selects
the TE tunnel as the backup path. TE protecting IP is implemented.

IS-IS Auto FRR traffic protection is classified into link protection and link-node dual
protection.

7.2.15 IS-IS TE
Conventional routers select the shortest path as the primary route regardless of
other factors, such as bandwidth. In this manner, traffic is not switched to other
paths even if a path is congested. MPLS traffic engineering (TE) has advantages in
solving the problem of network congestion. With MPLS TE, you can precisely
control the traffic path and prevent traffic from passing through congested nodes.
MPLS TE can reserve resources to ensure the quality of services during the
establishment of LSPs.
To ensure service continuity, MPLS TE introduces the route backup and fast reroute
(FRR) mechanisms to switch traffic in time when a link is faulty. MPLS TE allows
service providers (SPs) to fully utilize existing network resources to provide
diversified services. In addition, network resources can be optimized for scientific
network management.
To accomplish the preceding tasks, MPLS TE needs to learn TE information about
all devices on the network. However, MPLS TE lacks a mechanism in which each

device floods its TE information throughout the entire network for TE information
synchronization. However, IS-IS does provide such a mechanism. Therefore, MPLS
TE can advertise and synchronize TE information with the help of IS-IS.
IS-IS TE is an extension of IS-IS to support MPLS TE and complies with RFC 5305.
IS-IS TE defines new TLVs in IS-IS LSPs to carry TE information and floods LSPs to
flood and synchronize TE information. It extracts TE information from all LSPs and
then transmits the TE information to the Constraint Shortest Path First (CSPF)
module of MPLS for tunnel path calculation. IS-IS TE plays the role of a porter in
MPLS TE. Figure 7-28 shows the relationships between IS-IS TE, MPLS TE, and
CSPF.
Figure 7-28 Relationships between MPLS TE, CSPF, and IS-IS TE
New TLVs in IS-IS TE
To carry TE information in LSPs, IS-IS TE defines the following TLVs in RFC 5305:
● Extended IS reachability TLV
This TLV takes the place of IS reachability TLV and extends the TLV formats
with sub-TLVs. Sub-TLVs are implemented in TLVs in the same manner as TLVs
are implemented in LSPs. Sub-TLVs are used to carry TE information
configured on physical interfaces.
NOTE
Currently, all sub-TLVs defined in RFC 5305 are supported.

● Traffic Engineering router ID TLV
It is of TLV type 134, with a 4-byte Router ID. It is used as the MPLS LSR ID. In
MPLS TE, a Router ID uniquely identifies a router. Each router has a Router ID.
● Extended IP reachability TLV
This TLV takes the place of IP reachability TLV and carries routing information.
It extends the length of the route cost field and carries sub-TLVs.
● Shared Risk Link Group TLV
It is of TLV type 138 and used to carry information about the shared risk link
group. This TLV can carry information about multiple shared links, each of
which is a 4-byte positive integer.
IS-IS TE Implementation
IS-IS TE is implemented in two stages:
● Respond to MPLS TE configurations.
IS-IS TE functions only after MPLS TE is enabled.
IS-IS TE updates the TE information in IS-IS LSPs based on MPLS TE
configurations.
IS-IS TE transmits MPLS TE configurations to the CSPF module.
● Handle TE information in LSPs.
IS-IS TE extracts TE information from IS-IS LSPs and transmits the TE
information to the CSPF module.
In typical applications, IS-IS TE helps MPLS TE set up TE tunnels. As shown in
Figure 7-29, a TE tunnel is set up between RouterA and RouterD.

Figure 7-29 IS-IS TE networking
The networking configuration is as follows:
● Enable MPLS TE on RouterA, RouterB, RouterC, and RouterD and enable
MPLS TE CSPF on RouterA to calculate the tunnel path.
● Run IS-IS and enable IS-IS TE on RouterA, RouterB, RouterC, and RouterD to
implement communication between the four routers.
After the preceding configuration is complete, IS-IS on RouterA, RouterB, RouterC,
and RouterD sends LSPs carrying TE information configured on each router.
RouterA then obtains the TE information of RouterB, RouterC, and RouterD from
the received LSPs. The CSPF module can calculate the path required by the TE
tunnel based on the TE information on the entire network.
Route Calculation on TE Tunnel Interfaces
IS-IS Shortcut (AA) and IS-IS Advertise (FA) calculate routes through TE tunnel
interfaces. For traffic transmitted through a specific route, MPLS guarantees
reliable forwarding whereas IP is less reliable. MPLS forwarding is achieved when
IS-IS Shortcut (AA) and IS-IS Advertise (FA) are configured, with TE tunnel
interfaces involved in route calculation and defined as the outbound interfaces of
specific routes.

IS-IS Shortcut (AA) and IS-IS Advertise (FA) have the following differences:
● IS-IS Advertise (FA) advertises TE tunnel information to other ISs, whereas IS-
IS Shortcut (AA) does not.
As shown in Figure 7-30, if the TE tunnel is enabled with IS-IS Advertise (FA),
RouterA advertises information indicating that RouterC is its neighbor. The
neighbor information is carried in TLV type 22 with no sub-TLVs. That is, no TE
information is carried. If the TE tunnel is enabled with IS-IS Shortcut (AA),
RouterA does not advertise such information.
● IS-IS Advertise (FA) affects the SPF tree of other routers, whereas IS-IS
Shortcut (AA) does not.
IS-IS Shortcut (AA) does not affect the original structure of the IS-IS SPF tree,
irrespective of whether a TE tunnel exists or not. Apart from the link from
RouterA to RouterB, and that from RouterB to RouterC, a link marked with
Shortcut from RouterA to RouterC is added. The link marked with Shortcut
participates in route calculation.
If the TE tunnel is enabled with IS-IS Advertise (FA), RouterA advertises the
message that "RouterC is a neighbor of RouterA" to other routers on the
network. Other routers then consider RouterC a neighbor of RouterA and add
RouterC to the SPF tree without marking it with Shortcut.
● IS-IS Advertise (FA) does not support a relative metric, whereas IS-IS Shortcut
(AA) does.
IS-IS Shortcut (AA) supports an absolute metric and a relative metric.
If you use an absolute metric, the metric value of TE tunnels in IS-IS is fixed. If
you use a relative metric, the metric value of TE tunnels in IS-IS is the sum of
the physical link cost and relative metric. As shown in Figure 7-30, if the
relative metric is set to 1, the cost of the path from RouterA to RouterC
through the TE tunnel is 21 (10+10+1). If the relative metric is set to 0, the TE
tunnel and physical link are of equal-cost on the outbound interface. If the
relative metric is less than 0, the TE tunnel interface is preferred as the
outbound interface.
● IS-IS Advertise (FA) requires bidirectional TE tunnels, whereas IS-IS Shortcut
(AA) requires only unidirectional tunnels.
7.2.16 IS-IS Local MT
IS-IS local multicast-topology (MT) creates a separate multicast topology on the
local device, without affecting the protocol packets exchanged between devices, to
allow both TE tunnels and multicast to be configured on the backbone network.
NOTE
The mentioned TE tunnel specifies the TE tunnel enabled with IGP Shortcut (AA).
Background
When multicast and an MPLS TE tunnel are deployed in a network simultaneously,
the multicast function may be affected by the TE tunnel.
This is because after the TE tunnel is enabled with IS-IS Shortcut (AA), the
outbound interface of a route calculated by an IS-IS is not the actual physical

interface but a TE tunnel interface. According to the unicast route to the multicast
source address, a router sends a Report message through a TE tunnel interface.
Routers spanned by the TE tunnel cannot sense the Report message, so multicast
forwarding entries cannot be created. The TE tunnel is unidirectional, so multicast
data packets sent by the multicast source are sent to the routers spanned by the
tunnel through the related physical interfaces. The routers do not have any
multicast forwarding entry. Therefore, the multicast data packets are discarded.
Figure 7-31 TE tunnel scenario
As shown in Figure 7-31, RouterA, RouterB, RouterC, RouterD, and RouterE are
Level-2 routers. The routers run IS-IS to implement interconnection. The multicast
services are normal. A unidirectional MPLS TE tunnel is set up between RouterB
and RouterD. The MPLS TE tunnel is enabled with IS-IS Shortcut (AA). When you
view the multicast routing table on RouterC spanned by the TE tunnel, you cannot
find any multicast forwarding entry. Therefore, the multicast services are
interrupted.
The process of transmitting multicast packets between the client and the multicast
server is as follows:
1. To join a multicast group, the client sends a Report message to RouterA.
RouterA then sends a Join message to RouterB.
2. When the Join message reaches RouterB, RouterB uses Tunnel 1/0/0 as the
Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) interface and forwards the message to
RouterC through GE 2/0/0 by using the MPLS label.
3. The Join message is forwarded with the MPLS label, so RouterC just forwards
the message and does not create a multicast routing entry. In the topology
shown in Figure 7-31, RouterC is the penultimate hop of the MPLS
forwarding. RouterC pops out the MPLS label, and then forwards the Join
message to RouterD through GE 2/0/0.

Switches

4. After receiving the Join message, RouterD creates a multicast forwarding
entry. The inbound interface is GE 2/0/0 and the outbound interface is GE
1/0/0. RouterD then forwards the message to RouterE. The SPT is set up.
5. When the multicast source sends the traffic to RouterD, RouterD forwards the
traffic to RouterC. RouterC does not create any forwarding entry in advance.
Therefore, the traffic is discarded and the multicast service is interrupted.
As described in the preceding process of transmitting multicast packets, the
forwarding of multicast packets relies on the unicast routing table, and the TE
tunnel is unidirectional. Therefore, the multicast packets are discarded. This
problem can be avoided by using the following methods:
● Manually configuring static multicast routes to guide the forwarding of
multicast packets.
● Configuring a bidirectional TE tunnel. In this case, the returned multicast
packets can be sent by using the same tunnel. Routers spanned by the TE
tunnel use the tunnel to transmit multicast packets.
● Configuring the Multicast Border Gateway Protocol (MBGP) to separate the
unicast topology from the multicast topology. MBGP provides the topology
that does not contain the TE tunnel for multicast separately. Multicast is used
to perform RPF check on MBGP routes.
● Configuring local MT
The preceding methods are used to prevent the interruption of multicast services.
The disadvantage of the first three methods is that a lot of manual configurations
need to be done. As a result, if the network is complex, the planning,
configuration, and maintenance tasks become heavier. Therefore, in the preceding
network environment, local MT needs to be configured.
Principles
Local MT creates a separate multicast topology on the local device, without
affecting the protocol packets exchanged between devices. This ensures that
multicast services are still available when both multicast and the MPLS TE tunnel
enabled with IGP Shortcut are deployed.
After local MT is enabled, the router at the ingress of a TE tunnel creates a
separate multicast IGP (MIGP) routing table to store the physical interfaces
corresponding to the TE tunnel. This ensures that multicast protocol packets are
correctly forwarded. The correct routing entries are created in the multicast
routing table (MRT). The implementation of local MT can be divided into two
stages:
● Create an MIGP routing table.
Multicast protocol packets are forwarded according to the unicast routing
table. After local MT is enabled on RouterB, RM creates separate MIGP
routing tables for multicast protocols. When the outbound interface of a route
is a TE tunnel interface, an IGP calculates the actual physical outbound
interface for the route and adds the outbound interface to the MIGP routing
table.
● Guide the forwarding of multicast protocol packets.
Before forwarding a multicast protocol packet, a router needs to search the
unicast routing table. If the router finds that the next hop is the TE tunnel, the
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 523
router continues to search the MIGP routing table for the related physical
outbound interface to guide the forwarding of the multicast protocol packet.
Figure 7-32 Local MT Topology
As shown in Figure 7-32, if the outbound interface of multicast source
192.168.3.2/24 is TE tunnel 1/0/0, the physical outbound interface of the route
calculated by IS-IS is GE 2/0/0. IS-IS installs the route to the MIGP routing table.
The multicast services are not affected by the TE tunnel. Multicast packets are
forwarded through the physical outbound interfaces according to the MIGP
routing table for the general IP forwarding. The related routing entries are created
in the MRT. Multicast data packets are then correctly forwarded.
7.2.17 IS-IS Multi-Instance and Multi-Process
On a VPN-supporting device, you can associate multiple VPN instances with
multiple IS-IS processes to implement IS-IS multi-instance. IS-IS multi-process
allows you to create multiple IS-IS processes in the same VPN (or on the public
network). These IS-IS processes are independent of each other. Route exchange
between IS-IS processes is similar to route exchange between routing protocols.
Each IS-IS process can be bound to a specified VPN instance. A typical application
is as follows: In a VPN, IS-IS runs between PEs and CEs and also runs on the VPN
backbone network. On the PEs, the two IS-IS processes are independent of each
other.
IS-IS multi-instance and multi-process have the following characteristics:
● IS-IS multi-processes share an RM routing table. IS-IS multi-instances use the
RM routing tables in VPNs, and each VPN has its own RM routing table.
● IS-IS multi-process allows a set of interfaces to be associated with a specified
IS-IS process. This ensures that the specified IS-IS process performs all the
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 524
protocol operations only on this set of interfaces. In this manner, multiple IS-
IS processes can work on a single router and each process is responsible for
managing a unique set of interfaces.
● When creating an IS-IS process, you can bind it to a VPN instance to associate
the IS-IS process with the VPN instance. The IS-IS process accepts and
processes only the events related to the VPN instance. When the bound VPN
instance is deleted, the IS-IS process is also deleted.

Table 7-9 IS-IS configuration tasks
Scenario Description Task
Configuring basic IS-IS
functions
To deploy the IS-IS
protocol on IPv4
networks, configure basic
IS-IS functions to enable
communication between
different nodes on the
network. Other IS-IS
features can only be
configured after the
basic functions are
configured.
7.6 Configure Basic IS-
IS Functions
Configuring IS-IS
network security
On IS-IS networks,
unauthorized users can
attack the IS-IS network
by modifying data
packets or forging
authorized users. To
ensure security of
services carried on IS-IS
networks, configure area
or domain
authentication and
interface authentication.
7.7 Improving IS-IS
Network Security
Configuring IS-IS route
selection
If multiple redundant
links are available in the
network using the IS-IS
protocol, the route in the
IS-IS routing table may
not be the expected
optimal route. This does
not meet the network
planning and traffic
management
requirements. To
optimize the IS-IS
network and facilitate
traffic management,
more accurate control of
the routes on the
network is required.

Scenario Description Task
Configuring IS-IS routing
information exchange
In practical applications,
to meet network
requirements, configure
route policies to
accurately control
advertising and receiving
of IS-IS routing
information.
7.9 Controlling IS-IS
Route Exchange
Configuring IS-IS route
aggregation
Route aggregation
allows multiple routes
with the same IP prefix
to be aggregated into
one route.
Route aggregation on a
large IS-IS network can
effectively reduce entries
in the routing table. This
minimizes system
resource consumption
and facilitates
management. In
addition, if a link in the
aggregated IP address
segment frequently
alternates between Up
and Down, devices
outside this segment will
not be affected by the
change. This prevents
route flapping and
improves network
stability.
7.10 Configuring IS-IS
Route Summarization
Configuring IS-IS route
convergence
To enable IS-IS to rapidly
detect the network
changes, speed up the
IS-IS network
convergence. To
minimize the effect on
networks from route
flapping and reduce load
on the device, slow down
the IS-IS network
convergence.

Scenario Description Task
Configuring LSP
fragment extension
When information
contained in the LSP
data packet Protocol
Data Unit (PDU) to be
advertised by IS-IS
increases greatly, the IS-
IS device will generate
multiple LSP fragments
to carry and advertise
more information.
7.12 Configuring LSP
Fragment Extension
Configuring mesh groups On the NBMA network,
when an interface of the
switch receives a new
LSP, the LSP is flooded to
other interfaces of the
switch. On highly-
connected networks that
have multiple P2P links,
this processing method
results in repeated LSP
flooding and wastes
bandwidth resources.
To solve this problem,
create a mesh group and
add some interfaces to
the group. The switch
never floods the LSPs
received at interfaces in
the mesh group to other
interfaces from the same
group, and only floods
the LSPs to interfaces
from other groups or
interfaces that are not
configured to any mesh
groups.

Scenario Description Task
Improving IS-IS reliability To ensure rapid recovery
from failures on
networks using the IS-IS
protocol, adopt the
solution of fast fault
detection and standby
link switchover. However,
the IS-IS fault detection
mechanism and link
switchover require a long
period of time, which
fails to meet the
requirements of services
that are highly sensitive
to packet loss and
packet delay.
To meet requirements of
these services, use BFD
for IS-IS to implement
fast fault detection and
use IS-IS GR helper to
implement fast
switchover. This improves
IS-IS reliability.
7.14 Configuring IS-IS
Reliability
Configuring IS-IS
overload
If the system cannot
store new LSPs or
synchronize the LSDB
normally, the calculated
routing information will
be incorrect. In this case,
the system can enter the
overload state. Routes
reached through the
device will not be
calculated, but routes
directly connected to the
device will not be
ignored.
When an IS-IS device on
the network requires
upgrade or maintenance,
the device needs to be
temporarily isolated
from the network. To
prevent other devices
from forwarding traffic
through this node, set
the overload bit for the
device in question.

7.6 Configure Basic IS-IS Functions
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring basic IS-IS functions, configure IP addresses for interfaces to
ensure that neighboring nodes are reachable at the network layer.
Configuration Procedure
Creating an IS-IS process is the prerequisite for configuring a network entity title
(NET), configuring the device level, and establishing an IS-IS neighbor relationship.

7.6.1 Creating IS-IS Processes
Context
Creating IS-IS processes is the prerequisite for performing IS-IS configurations.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run isis [
process-id ] [ vpn-instance
vpn-instance-name ]
An IS-IS process is created, and the IS-IS process view is displayed.
The
process-id parameter specifies the ID of an IS-IS process. If the
process-id is
not specified, the value of
process-id is 1 by default. To associate the IS-IS process
with a VPN instance, specify the VPN instance name.
Step 3 (Optional) Run description
description
A description is configured for the IS-IS process.
Step 4 (Optional) Enable IS-IS to add the POI and hostname TLV to Purge LSPs.
Run purge-originator-identification enable [ always ]
IS-IS is enabled to determine whether to add the POI TLV and hostname TLV to
Purge LSPs based on the authentication configuration.
● If the purge-originator-identification enable command is run and the send-
only parameter is specified when configuring authentication, generated Purge
LSPs do not carry the POI TLV or hostname TLV.
● If the purge-originator-identification enable command is run and MD5 or
HMAC-MD5 authentication is configured, generated Purge LSPs do not carry
the POI TLV or hostname TLV. If the purge-originator-identification enable
command is run and authentication of another type is configured or no
authentication is configured, generated Purge LSPs carry the POI TLV and
hostname TLV.
● If the purge-originator-identification enable always command is run,
generated Purge LSPs carry the POI TLV and hostname TLV, regardless of
whether authentication is configured or whether the send-only parameter is
specified when configuring authentication.
----End
7.6.2 Configuring a NET
Context
NET is the special form of the network service access point (NSAP). After the IS-IS
view is displayed, IS-IS can start only when a NET is configured for an IS-IS
process.
Generally, you only need to configure one NET for an IS-IS process. When an area
needs to be redefined, for example, the area needs to be merged with other areas
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 531
or divided into sub-areas, configure multiple NETs to ensure route correctness. A
maximum of three area addresses can be configured for an IS-IS process.
Therefore, a maximum of three NETs can be configured for an IS-IS process. When
configuring multiple NETs, ensure that their system IDs are the same.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run isis [
process-id ]
The IS-IS process view is displayed.
Step 3 Run network-entity
net
A NET is configured.
NOTE
Configuring loopback interface addresses based on NETs is recommended to ensure that a
NET is unique on the network. If NETs are not unique, route flapping will easily occur.
An area ID uniquely identifies an area in the same IS-IS domain. All routers in the same
Level-1 area must share the same area ID, while routers in the same Level-2 area can have
different area IDs.
----End
7.6.3 Configuring the Device Level
Context
Configure the device level according to network planning requirements:
● When the level of a device is Level-1, the device establishes neighbor
relationships with only Level-1 and Level-1-2 routers in the same area and
maintains only Level-1 LSDBs.
● When the level of a device is Level-2, the device can establish neighbor
relationship with Level-2 routers in the same area or different areas and with
Level-1-2 routers in different areas and maintain only Level-2 LSDB.
● When the level of a device is Level-1-2, the device can establish neighbor
relationships with Level-1 and Level-2 routers and maintain Level-1 and
Level-2 LSDBs.
NOTICE
If the levels of IS-IS devices are changed during network operation, the IS-IS
process will be restarted and IS-IS neighbor relationships will be disconnected.
Setting the levels of devices when configuring IS-IS is recommended.

The level of the switch is configured.
By default, the level of the switch is Level-1-2.
----End
7.6.4 Establishing IS-IS Neighbor Relationships
Context
The methods to establish IS-IS neighbor relationships on a broadcast network and
a P2P network are different. Therefore, you need to set different IS-IS attributes
for different types of interfaces:
● On a broadcast network, IS-IS needs to select the designated intermediate
system (DIS). You can set the DIS priority for IS-IS interfaces to enable the
device with the highest DIS priority to be elected as the DIS.
● On a P2P network, IS-IS does not need to select the DIS. Therefore, the DIS
priority does not need to be configured for interfaces. To ensure P2P link
reliability, configure IS-IS to establish a neighbor relationship on two P2P
interfaces in 3-way mode for unidirectional link fault detection.
Generally, IS-IS checks the IP addresses of received Hello packets. A neighbor
relationship can be established only when the source IP address carried in a
received Hello packet and the address of the interface that receives the Hello
packet are on the same network segment. If the IP addresses of the two P2P
interfaces are on different network segments, and the isis peer-ip-ignore
command is run on the two interfaces, IS-IS does not check the peer IP
address. The neighbor relationship can be correctly established on the two
P2P interfaces.
Procedure
● Establish an IS-IS neighbor relationship on a broadcast link.
a. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
b. Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
c. (Optional) On an Ethernet interface, run undo portswitch
The interface is switched to Layer 3 mode.
By default, an Ethernet interface works in Layer 2 mode.

3 modes.
d. Run isis enable [
process-id ]
IS-IS is enabled on the interface.
After this command is run, IS-IS establishes neighbor relationships and
floods LSPs through this interface.
NOTE
Loopback interfaces are not used to establish neighbor relationships. If IS-IS is
enabled on a loopback interface, IS-IS advertises the routes of the network
segment where the interface resides through other IS-IS interfaces.
e. Run isis circuit-level [ level-1 | level-1-2 | level-2 ]
The level of the interface is configured.
By default, the level of an interface is level-1-2.
When two Level-1-2 devices establish an IS-IS neighbor relationship, they
establish both Level-1 and Level-2 neighbor relationships. To allow the
two Level-1-2 devices to establish only Level-1 or Level-2 neighbor
relationship, change the level of interfaces.
NOTE
Changing the level of an IS-IS interface is valid only when the level of the IS-IS
device is Level-1-2. If the level of the device is not Level-1-2, the level of the
device determines the level of the established neighbor relationship.
f. (Optional) Run isis dis-priority
priority [ level-1 | level-2 ]
The DIS priority is set for the interface. A larger value indicates a higher
priority.
By default, the DIS priority of Level-1 and Level-2 broadcast interfaces is
64.
Level-1-2 broadcast interfaces select the DIS using Level-1 and Level-2
separately. To select the DIS only for Level-1 or Level-2 interfaces, specify
the level.
g. (Optional) Run isis silent [ advertise-zero-cost ]
The interface is suppressed.
By default, an IS-IS interface is not suppressed.
When an IS-IS interface is suppressed, the interface no longer sends or
receives IS-IS packets. The routes of the network segment where the
interface resides, however, can still be advertised to other IS-IS devices
within the same AS.
h. (Optional) Configure a delay for the IS-IS neighbor relationship
establishment.

A delay is configured for the IS-IS neighbor relationship establishment.
On an IS-IS network, if the IS-IS link has the network transmission delay
or transmission error, a few Hello packets may be lost or incorrectly
transmitted. In this case, the neighbor relationship frequently changes
between the Up and Down states, leading to route flapping.
By default,
delay-interval is 60s.
If a new
delay-interval is configured and it is less than the remaining
time of the ongoing delay, the new
delay-interval takes effect
immediately; if the new
delay-interval is greater than the remaining time
of the ongoing delay, the ongoing delay continues until the new
delay-
interval takes effect at the next delay.
● Establish an IS-IS neighbor relationship on a P2P link.
a. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
b. Run interface

IS-IS is enabled on the interface.
e. Run isis circuit-level [ level-1 | level-1-2 | level-2 ]
The level of the interface is configured.
By default, the level of an interface is level-1-2.
f. Run isis circuit-type p2p [ strict-snpa-check ]
The network type of the interface is set to P2P.
By default, the network type of an interface is determined by the physical
type of the interface.
When the network type of an IS-IS interface changes, the interface
configuration changes accordingly:

▪ After the undo isis circuit-type command is run to restore the
default network type of an IS-IS interface, the interval for sending
Hello packets, number of Hello packets that IS-IS does not receive
from a neighbor before the neighbor is declared Down, interval for
retransmitting LSPs on a P2P link, various IS-IS authentication
modes, DIS priority, and interval for sending CSNPs on a broadcast
network are restored to the default settings.
g. Run isis ppp-negotiation { 2-way | 3-way [ only ] }
The negotiation mode is specified for the interface.
By default, the negotiation mode is 3-way.
h. Run isis peer-ip-ignore
IS-IS is configured to not check the IP addresses of received Hello packets.
By default, IS-IS checks the IP addresses of received Hello packets.
i. Run isis ppp-osicp-check
OSICP negotiation status check is configured on the interface.
By default, the OSICP negotiation status of a PPP interface does not
affect the status of an IS-IS interface.
NOTE
This command applies only to PPP interfaces and is invalid for other P2P
interfaces.
After this command is run, the OSICP negotiation status of a PPP interface
affects the status of an IS-IS interface. When PPP detects that the OSI network
fails, the link status of the IS-IS interface goes Down and the routes of the
network segment where the interface resides are not advertised through LSPs.
j. (Optional) Configure a delay for the IS-IS neighbor relationship
establishment.
Run isis delay-peer track last-peer-expired [ delay-time
delay-
interval ]
A delay is configured for the IS-IS neighbor relationship establishment.
On an IS-IS network, if the IS-IS link has the network transmission delay
or transmission error, a few Hello packets may be lost or incorrectly
transmitted. In this case, the neighbor relationship frequently changes
between the Up and Down states, leading to route flapping.
By default,
delay-interval is 60s.
If a new
delay-interval is configured and it is less than the remaining
time of the ongoing delay, the new
delay-interval takes effect
immediately; if the new
delay-interval is greater than the remaining time
of the ongoing delay, the ongoing delay continues until the new
delay-
interval takes effect at the next delay.

7.7 Improving IS-IS Network Security
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before improving IS-IS network security, configure basic IS-IS functions.
Configuration Procedure
You can perform the following configuration tasks (excluding the task of Verifying
the IS-IS Network Security Optimization Configuration) in any sequence.
7.7.1 Configuring Interface Authentication
Context
Generally, IS-IS packets are sent without authentication information encapsulation,
and the received packets are not authenticated. If a user sends malicious packets
to attack a network, information on the entire network may be stolen. Therefore,
you can configure IS-IS authentication to improve network security.
After IS-IS interface authentication is configured, authentication information can
be encapsulated into Hello packets to confirm the validity and correctness of
neighbor.
NOTICE
If plain is selected during the configuration of the authentication mode for the IS-
IS interface, the password is saved in the configuration file in plain text. This
brings security risks. It is recommended that you select cipher to save the
password in cipher text.
Simple authentication and MD5 authentication have potential security risks.
HMAC-SHA256 or Keychain authentication mode is recommended.

Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
Step 3 (Optional) On an Ethernet interface, run undo portswitch
The interface is switched to Layer 3 mode.
By default, an Ethernet interface works in Layer 2 mode.
NOTE
Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H,
S6730-S, and S6730S-S support switching between Layer 2 and Layer 3 modes.
Step 4 Run any of the following commands to configure the authentication mode of the
IS-IS interface as required:
● Run isis authentication-mode simple { plain
plain-text | [ cipher ]
plain-
cipher-text } [ level-1 | level-2 ] [ ip | osi ] [ send-only ]
Simple authentication is configured for the IS-IS interface.
● Run isis authentication-mode md5 { plain
plain-text | [ cipher ]
plain-
cipher-text } [ level-1 | level-2 ] [ ip | osi ] [ send-only ]
MD5 authentication is configured for the IS-IS interface.
● Run isis authentication-mode hmac-sha256 key-id
key-id { plain
plain-text |
[ cipher ]
plain-cipher-text } [ level-1 | level-2 ] [ send-only ]
HMAC-SHA256 authentication is configured for the IS-IS interface.
● Run isis authentication-mode keychain
keychain-name [ level-1 | level-2 ]
[ send-only ]
Keychain authentication is configured for the IS-IS interface.
By default, an IS-IS interface does not authenticate received Hello packets and no
authentication password is configured on the interface.
NOTE
Use the send-only parameter according to network requirements:
● If the send-only parameter is specified, the device only encapsulates the Hello packets
to be sent with authentication information rather than checks whether the received
Hello packets pass the authentication. When the Hello packets do not need to be
authenticated on the local device and pass the authentication on the remote device,
the two devices can establish the neighbor relationship.
● If the send-only parameter is not specified, ensure that passwords of all interfaces
with the same level on the same network are the same.
Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H,
S6730-S, and S6730S-S support keychain
keychain-name.

7.7.2 Configuring Area or Domain Authentication
Context
Generally, the IS-IS packets to be sent are not encapsulated with authentication
information, and the received packets are not authenticated. If a user sends
malicious packets to attack a network, information on the entire network may be
stolen. Therefore, you can configure IS-IS authentication to improve network
security.
The area authentication password is encapsulated into Level-1 IS-IS packets. Only
the packets that pass the area authentication can be accepted. Therefore, you
must configure IS-IS area authentication on all the IS-IS devices in the specified
Level-1 area to authenticate the Level-1 area.
The domain authentication password is encapsulated into Level-2 IS-IS packets.
Only the packets that pass the domain authentication can be accepted. Therefore,
you must configure IS-IS domain authentication on all the IS-IS devices in the
Level-2 area to authenticate Level-2 area.
NOTICE
If plain is selected during the configuration of the area authentication mode or
domain authentication mode, the password is saved in the configuration file in
plain text. This brings security risks. It is recommended that you select cipher to
save the password in cipher text.
Simple authentication and MD5 authentication have potential security risks.
HMAC-SHA256 or Keychain authentication mode is recommended.
Characters %^%# are used as the prefix and suffix of existing passwords with
variable lengths. Therefore, characters %^%# cannot be configured together at
the beginning or end of a cipher text password.
NOTE
When configuring IS-IS authentication, the area or domain authentication modes and
passwords of the routers in the same area must be consistent so that IS-IS packets can be
flooded normally.
Whether IS-IS packets can pass area or domain authentication does not affect the
establishment of Level-1 or Level-2 neighbor relationships.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run isis [

The IS-IS process view is displayed.
Step 3 Perform the following operations in any sequence as required.

sha256 key-id
key-id } [ snp-packet { authentication-avoid | send-only } |
all-send-only ]
The area authentication mode is configured.
By default, the system neither encapsulates generated Level-1 packets with
authentication information nor authenticates received Level-1 packets.
● Run domain-authentication-mode { { simple | md5 } { plain
plain-text |
[ cipher ]
plain-cipher-text } [ ip | osi ] | keychain
keychain-name | hmac-
sha256 key-id
key-id } [ snp-packet { authentication-avoid | send-only } |
all-send-only ]
The domain authentication mode is configured.
By default, the system neither encapsulates generated Level-2 packets with
authentication information nor authenticates received Level-2 packets.
NOTE
Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H,
S6730-S, and S6730S-S support the keychain
keychain-name parameter.
The authentication involves the following situations:
● The device encapsulates the authentication mode into LSPs and SNPs to be sent and
checks whether the received packets pass authentication. Then, the device discards the
packets that do not pass the authentication. In this case, the parameter snp-packet or
all-send-only is not specified.
● The device encapsulates authentication information into LSPs to be sent and checks
whether the received LSPs pass the authentication; the device neither encapsulates the
SNPs to be sent with authentication information nor checks whether the received SNPs
pass the authentication. In this case, the parameter snp-packet authentication-avoid
needs to be specified.
● The device encapsulates the LSPs and SNPs to be sent with authentication information;
the device, however, checks the authentication mode of only the received LSPs rather
than the received SNPs. In this case, the parameter snp-packet send-only needs to be
specified.
● The device encapsulates the LSPs and SNPs to be sent with authentication information,
but does not check whether the received LSPs or SNPs pass the authentication. In this
case, the parameter all-send-only needs to be specified.
----End
7.7.3 Configuring the Optional Checksum
Context
When a network is running, Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)
routers may be attacked or IS-IS packets may be modified. As a result, important
network information may be intercepted, causing serious loss to the network. The
optional checksum encapsulates optional checksum TLVs into the Complete
Sequence Numbers Protocol Data Units (CSNPs), Partial Sequence Number
Protocol Data Units (PSNPs), and Hello packets sent by IS-IS routers. When the
peer device receives the encapsulated packets, it checks whether TLVs carried in
the packets are correct. If TLVs are not correct, the peer device discards the
packets for network security.

7.8 Controlling IS-IS Route Selection
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring IS-IS route selection, configure basic IS-IS functions.
Configuration Procedure
You can perform the following configuration tasks (excluding the task of Verifying
the IS-IS Route Selection Control Configuration) in any sequence.
7.8.1 Configuring a Preference Value for IS-IS
Context
If multiple routes to the same destination are discovered by different routing
protocols running on the same device, the route discovered by the protocol with
the highest preference is selected.
To prefer a route discovered by IS-IS, configure a higher preference value for IS-IS.
In addition, a routing policy can be configured to increase the preferences of
specified IS-IS routes, without affecting route selection.

The IS-IS view is displayed.
Step 3 Run preference {
preference | route-policy

The IS-IS preference value is configured.
The default IS-IS preference value is 15. A smaller
preference value indicates a
higher preference.
----End
7.8.2 Configuring the Cost of an IS-IS Interface
Context
The costs of IS-IS interfaces can be determined in the following modes in
descending order of priority:
● Interface cost: is configured for a specified interface.
● Global cost: is configured for all interfaces.
● Automatically calculated cost: is automatically calculated based on the
interface bandwidth.
If no cost is configured for an IS-IS interface, the IS-IS interface uses the default
cost 10 and cost style narrow.
NOTICE
If you want to change the cost style of IS-IS devices, running the command while
configuring basic IS-IS functions is recommended. If the cost style of IS-IS devices
is changed during network operation, the IS-IS process is restarted and the
neighbor relationship is re-established.
Procedure
Step 1 Configure the IS-IS cost style.
1. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
2. Run isis [
process-id ]
The IS-IS view is displayed.
3. Run cost-style { narrow | wide | wide-compatible | { narrow-compatible |

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 7 IPv4 IS-IS Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 542
By default, the cost style of routes received and sent by an IS-IS device is
narrow.
The cost range of an interface and a route received by the interface vary with the
cost type.
● If the cost style is narrow, the cost of an interface ranges from 1 to 63. The
maximum cost of a route received by the interface is 1023.
● If the cost style is narrow-compatible or compatible, the cost of an interface
ranges from 1 to 63. The cost of a received route is related to relax-spf-limit.
● If the cost style is wide-compatible or wide, the cost of the interface ranges
from 1 to 16777215. When the cost is 16777215, the neighbor TLV generated
on the link cannot be used for route calculation but for the transmission of TE
information. The maximum cost of a received route is 0xFFFFFFFF.
Step 2 Configure the cost of an IS-IS interface.
Perform any of the following operations to configure the cost of an IS-IS interface.
Configure the cost of a specified IS-IS interface.
1. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
2. Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
3. (Optional) On an Ethernet interface, run undo portswitch
The interface is switched to Layer 3 mode.
By default, an Ethernet interface works in Layer 2 mode.
NOTE
Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-

4. Run auto-cost enable [ compatible ]
The interface is configured to automatically calculate its cost.
The bandwidth reference value set using the bandwidth-reference command
takes effect only when the cost style is wide or wide-compatible. In this case, the
interface cost is calculated using the following formula:
Cost of each interface = (Bandwidth-reference/Interface bandwidth) × 10
If the cost-style is narrow, narrow-compatible, or compatible, the cost of each
interface is calculated based on costs listed in Table 7-10.

7.8.3 Configuring Equal-Cost IS-IS Routes
Context
If there are redundant IS-IS links, multiple routes may have an equal cost. Choose
either of the following methods to use these equal-cost IS-IS routes:

● Configure load balancing for equal-cost IS-IS routes so that traffic will be
evenly balanced among these links.
This mechanism increases the link bandwidth usage and prevents network
congestion caused by link overload. However, this mechanism may make
traffic management more difficult because traffic will be randomly forwarded.
● Configure preference values for equal-cost IS-IS routes so that only the route
with the highest preference will be used and the others function as backups.
This configuration facilitates traffic management and improves the network
reliability, without the need to change original configurations.
Procedure
● Configure equal-cost IS-IS routes to work in load-balancing mode.
a. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
b. Run isis [
process-id ]
The IS-IS view is displayed.
c. Run maximum load-balancing
number
The maximum number of load-balancing equal-cost IS-IS routes is set.
By default, the maximum number of equal-cost routes on the S5720I-SI,
S5735-S, S5735-S-I, S5735S-H, S6720S-S, and S5736-S is 8, and the
maximum number of equal-cost routes on the S5731-H, S5731-S,
S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S,
and S6730S-S is 16.
NOTE
When the number of equal-cost routes is larger than the value specified in the
maximum load-balancing command, valid routes are selected for load
balancing based on the following criteria:
1. Route preference: Routes with lower preference values (higher preferences)
are selected for load balancing.
2. Next hop system ID: If routes have the same preference, routes with smaller
system IDs are selected for load balancing.
3. Interface index: If routes have the same preference and system ID, routes with
lower interface index values are selected for load balancing.
● Configure preference values for equal-cost IS-IS routes.
a. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
b. Run isis [
process-id ]

c. Run nexthop
ip-address weight
value
A preference value is configured for an equal-cost IS-IS route.
By default, the preference value configured for equal-cost IS-IS routes is

7.8.4 Configuring IS-IS Route Leaking
Context
If multiple Level-1-2 devices in a Level-1 area are connected to devices in the
Level-2 area, a Level-1 LSP sent by each Level-1-2 device carries an ATT flag bit of
1. This Level-1 area will have multiple routes to the Level-2 area and to other
Level-1 areas.
By default, routes in a Level-1 area can be leaked into the Level-2 area so that
Level-1-2 and Level-2 devices can determine the topology of the entire network.
Devices in a Level-1 area are unaware of the entire network topology because
they only maintain LSDBs in the local Level-1 area. Therefore, a device in a Level-1
area can forward traffic to a Level-2 device only through the nearest Level-1-2
device. The route used may not be the optimal route to the destination.
To enable a device in a Level-1 area to select the optimal route, configure IPv4 IS-
IS route leaking so that specified routes in the Level-2 area can be leaked into the
local Level-1 area.
Routes of services deployed only in the local Level-1 area do not need to be
leaked into the Level-2 area. A policy can be configured to leak only desired routes
into the Level-2 area.
Procedure
● Specify routes in the Level-2 area and other Level-1 areas that can be leaked
into the local Level-1 area.
a. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
b. Run isis [

Routes that meet the specified conditions in the Level-2 areas are leaked
into the local Level-1 area.
By default, routes in the Level-2 area are not leaked into Level-1 areas.
NOTE
The command is run on the Level-1-2 device that is connected to an external
area.

7.8.5 Controlling Whether a Level-1 Device Generates a IPv4
Default Route
Context
As defined in the IS-IS protocol, if a Level-1-2 device reaches more areas through a
Level-2 area than through a Level-1 area based on the link state database (LSDB),
the Level-1-2 device sets the ATT bit to 1 in the LSPs and sends the LSPs with the
ATT bit 1 to the Level-1 device. Upon receipt, the Level-1 device generates a
default route destined for the Level-1-2 device.
The preceding rules are used by default. You can set the ATT bit as required on a
live network.
Perform the following steps:
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run isis [
process-id ]
The IS-IS view is displayed.
Step 3 Run the following command as required:
● To set the ATT bit in the LSPs sent by the Level-1-2 device, run the attached-
bit advertise { always | never } command.
– If the always parameter is specified, the ATT bit is set to 1. After
receiving the LSPs carrying the ATT bit 1, the Level-1 device generates a
default route.
– If the never parameter is specified, the ATT bit is set to 0. After receiving
the LSPs carrying the ATT bit 0, the Level-1 device does not generate a
default route, which reduces the size of a routing table.
● To disable the Level-1 device from generating default routes even though it
receives the LSPs carrying the ATT bit 1, run the attached-bit avoid-learning
command.

You can perform the following configuration tasks (excluding the task of Verifying
the IS-IS Route Exchange Control Configuration) in any sequence.
7.9.1 Configuring IS-IS to Advertise a Default Route
Context
If IS-IS is configured to advertise a default route on a border device that has
external routes, the device advertises a default route 0.0.0.0/0 in the IS-IS routing
domain. All traffic destined for other routing domains is first forwarded to the
border device.
Configuring a static default route can also allow all the traffic to be first
forwarded to a border device, which then forwards the traffic outside an IS-IS
routing domain. However, this method leads to heavy workload in configuration
and management when a large number of devices are deployed on the network.
In addition, advertising default routes using IS-IS is flexible. If multiple border
devices are deployed, a routing policy can be configured to allow only the border
device that meets the specified conditions to advertise a default route, preventing
routing blackholes.

IS-IS is configured to advertise a default route.
By default, IS-IS does not advertise a default route.
----End
7.9.2 Configuring IS-IS to Import External Routes
Context
After IS-IS is configured to advertise a default route on a border device in an IS-IS
routing domain, all the traffic destined outside the IS-IS routing domain is
forwarded through the border device. This burdens the border device because
other devices in the IS-IS routing domain do not have the routes destined outside
the domain. If multiple border devices are deployed in the IS-IS routing domain,
optimal routes to other routing domains need to be selected.
To ensure optimal routes are selected, all the other devices in the IS-IS routing
domain must learn all or some external routes.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run isis [
process-id ]
The IS-IS view is displayed.
Step 3 Configure IS-IS to import external routes.
● When you need to set the cost of imported routes, run the import-route
{ { rip | isis | ospf } [
process-id ] | static | direct | unr | bgp [ permit-ibgp ] }
[ cost-type { external | internal } | cost
cost | tag
tag | route-policy
route-
policy-name | [ level-1 | level-2 | level-1-2 ] ] * command to configure IS-IS
to import external routes.
● When you need to retain the original cost of imported routes, run the import-
route { { rip | isis | ospf } [
process-id ] | direct | unr | bgp } inherit-cost
[ tag
tag | route-policy
route-policy-name | [ level-1 | level-2 | level-1-2 ] ] *
command to configure IS-IS to import external routes. In this case, the source
routing protocol of imported routes cannot be static.
NOTE
IS-IS will advertise all imported external routes to the IS-IS routing domain by default.

7.9.3 Configuring IS-IS to Advertise Specified External Routes
to an IS-IS Routing Domain
Context
When the local IS-IS device advertises imported external routes to other IS-IS
devices, routing policies can be configured to advertise only the external routes
that meet specified conditions if these devices do not require all the imported
external routes.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view

IS-IS is configured to advertise the external routes that meet specified conditions
to the IS-IS routing domain.

7.9.4 Adding Specified IS-IS Routes to the IP Routing Table
Context
Only routes in an IP routing table can be used to forward IP packets. An IS-IS
route can take effect only after this IS-IS route has been successfully added to an
IP routing table.
If an IS-IS route does not need to be added to a routing table, specify conditions,
such as a basic ACL, IP prefix, and routing policy, to filter routes so that only IS-IS
routes that meet the specified conditions can be added to an IP routing table. IS-IS
routes that do not meet the specified conditions cannot be added to the IP routing
table and cannot be selected to forward IP packets.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run isis [

7.9.5 Verifying the IS-IS Route Exchange Control Configuration
Procedure
● Run the display isis lsdb [ { level-1 | level-2 } | verbose | { local |
lsp-id | is-
name

command to check IS-IS LSDB information.
● Run the display isis route [
process-id | vpn-instance
vpn-instance-name ]
[ ipv4 ] [ verbose | [ level-1 | level-2 ] |
ip-address [
mask |
mask-length ] ] *
command to check IS-IS routing information.
● Run the display ip routing-table [ verbose ] command to check the IP
routing table.
----End
7.10 Configuring IS-IS Route Summarization
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring IS-IS route summarization, configure basic IS-IS functions.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run isis [
process-id ]
The IS-IS view is displayed.
Step 3 Run summary
ip-address mask [ avoid-feedback | generate_null0_route | tag
tag | [ level-1 | level-1-2 | level-2 ] ] *
The specified IS-IS routes are summarized into one IS-IS route.
NOTE
After route summarization is configured on a device, the local routing table still contains all
specific routes before the summarization. The routing tables on other devices contain only
the summary route, and the summary route is deleted only after all its specific routes are
deleted.
----End
Verifying the Configuration
● Run the display isis route command to check summary routes in the IS-IS
routing table.

7.11 Controlling IS-IS Route Convergence
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring IS-IS route convergence, configure basic IS-IS functions.
Configuration Procedure
You can perform the following configuration tasks (excluding the task of Verifying
the IS-IS Route Convergence Control Configuration) in any sequence.
7.11.1 Configuring Attributes for Hello Packets
Context
IS-IS maintains neighbor relationships between neighbors by sending and
receiving Hello packets. If the local device does not receive Hello packets from its
neighbor within a specified period, the device considers the neighbor Down.
In IS-IS, you can set the interval for sending Hello packets and the holding
multiplier of neighboring devices to control the holdtime of neighbor relationships
between the local device and neighbors.
● If the interval for sending Hello packets is too short, more system resources
are consumed to send Hello packets, causing a heavy CPU load.
● If the holdtime of neighboring devices is too long, the local device needs to
spend much time detecting the failure of neighbors, slowing down IS-IS route
convergence. If the holdtime of neighboring devices is too short, some Hello
packets may be lost or become incorrect because of network transmission
delay and errors. This will cause neighbor relationships to frequently alternate
between Up and Down and lead to route flapping on the IS-IS network.
NOTE
You are advised to set the same interval for sending Hello packets and same holding
multiplier of neighboring devices on all the devices on the IS-IS network. This method
prevents IS-IS route convergence from being slowed down when some devices detect
link failures at a lower speed than other devices.
Procedure
● Configure the interval for sending Hello packets.
a. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
b. Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
c. (Optional) On an Ethernet interface, run undo portswitch
The interface is switched to Layer 3 mode.

By default, an Ethernet interface works in Layer 2 mode.
NOTE
Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H,
S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support switching between Layer 2 and Layer
3 modes.
d. Run isis timer hello
hello-interval [ level-1 | level-2 ] [ conservative ]
The interval for sending Hello packets is set on an interface.
By default, the interval for sending Hello packets 10 seconds.
NOTE
Parameters level-1 and level-2 are configured only on broadcast interfaces.
On a broadcast link, there are Level-1 and Level-2 Hello packets. For different
types of packets, you can set different intervals. If no level is specified, both the
Level-1 timer and Level-2 timer are configured. On a P2P link, there is only one
type of Hello packets. Therefore, neither level-1 nor level-2 is required.
● Set the holding multiplier for neighboring devices.
a. Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
b. Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
c. (Optional) On an Ethernet interface, run undo portswitch
The interface is switched to Layer 3 mode.
By default, an Ethernet interface works in Layer 2 mode.
NOTE
Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H,
S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support switching between Layer 2 and Layer
3 modes.
d. Run isis timer holding-multiplier
number [ level-1 | level-2 ]
The holding multiplier of neighboring devices is set.
The default holding multiplier is 3. The holdtime of neighbor
relationships is three times the interval for sending Hello packets.
NOTE
Parameters level-1 and level-2 are configured only on broadcast interfaces.

7.11.2 Configuring Attributes for LSPs
Context
LSPs are used to exchange link state information. You can configure attributes for
LSPs to control the length and maximum lifetime of LSPs. To accelerate network

convergence, you can enable LSP fast flooding or reduce the minimum interval for
sending LSPs and the interval for updating LSPs to speed up LSP flooding.
However, too many CPU resources will be consumed if the network topology
changes frequently. In this situation, configure the intelligent timer for generating
LSPs. This timer can quickly respond to emergencies, speed up network
convergence, and improve CPU resource efficiency because its interval becomes
longer when the network changes frequently. The function and implementation of
different parameter configurations are shown in the following table.
Parameter

Function Implementation
Set the
maximum

Set the
size for
LSPs to be

and LSPs

When the volume of link status information
increases, the length of LSPs to be generated can
be increased to carry more information in each LSP.
Set the
maximum
lifetime for
LSPs
Set the
maximum
lifetime
for LSPs to
ensure the
validity of
an LSP
before its
updated
LSP is
received.
When a switch generates the system LSP, it fills in
the maximum lifetime for this LSP. After this LSP is
received by other switches, the lifetime of the LSP
is reduced gradually. If the switch does not receive
any more update LSPs and the lifetime of the LSP is
reduced to 0, the LSP will be deleted from the LSDB
60s later if no more updated LSPs are received.
Set the
refresh
interval for
LSPs
Set the
refresh
interval
for LSPs to
synchroniz
e LSDBs.
On an IS-IS network, LSDB synchronization is
implemented through LSP flooding. During LSP
flooding, a switch sends an LSP to its neighbors
and then the neighbors send the received LSP to
their respective neighbors except the switch that
first sends the LSP. In this manner, the LSP is
flooded among the switches of the same level. LSP
flooding allows each switch of the same level to
have the same LSP information and synchronize its
LSDB with each other.
Set the
minimum
interval at
which LSPs
are sent
Set the
interval
for
sending
an LSP
during LSP
update.
Reducing the minimum interval for sending LSPs
speeds up LSP flooding.
