Italic Command arguments are in
italics.
[ ] Items (keywords or arguments) in brackets [ ] are
optional.
{ x | y | ... } Optional items are grouped in braces and separated
by vertical bars. One item is selected.
[ x | y | ... ] Optional items are grouped in brackets and
separated by vertical bars. One item is selected or
no item is selected.
{ x | y | ... }* Optional items are grouped in braces and separated
by vertical bars. A minimum of one item or a
maximum of all items can be selected.

separated by vertical bars. Several items or no item
can be selected.
&<1-n> The parameter before the & sign can be repeated 1
to n times.

Interface Numbering Conventions
Interface numbers used in this manual are examples. In device configuration, use
the existing interface numbers on devices.
Security Conventions
● Password setting
– To ensure device security, use ciphertext when configuring a password
and change the password periodically.
– The switch considers all passwords starting and ending with %^%#, %#
%#, %@%@ or @%@% as ciphertext and attempts to decrypt them. If
you configure a plaintext password that starts and ends with %^%#, %#
%#, %@%@ or @%@%, the switch decrypts it and records it into the
configuration file (plaintext passwords are not recorded for the sake of
security). Therefore, do not set a password starting and ending with %^
%#, %#%#, %@%@ or @%@%.
– When you configure passwords in ciphertext, different features must use
different ciphertext passwords. For example, the ciphertext password set
for the AAA feature cannot be used for other features.
● Encryption algorithms

The switch currently supports the 3DES, AES, RSA, SHA1, SHA2, and MD5.
3DES, RSA, and AES are reversible, whereas SHA1, SHA2, and MD5 are
irreversible. Using the encryption algorithms DES, 3DES, RSA (RSA-1024 or
lower), MD5 (in digital signature scenarios and password encryption), or
SHA1 (in digital signature scenarios) is a security risk. If protocols allow, use
more secure encryption algorithms, such as AES, RSA (RSA-2048 or higher),
SHA2, or HMAC-SHA2.
An irreversible encryption algorithm must be used for the administrator
password. SHA2 is recommended for this purpose.
● Personal data
Some personal data (such as MAC or IP addresses of terminals) may be
obtained or used during operation or fault location of your purchased
products, services, features, so you have an obligation to make privacy policies
and take measures according to the applicable law of the country to protect
personal data.
● Mirroring
The terms mirrored port, port mirroring, traffic mirroring, and mirroring in this
document are mentioned only to describe the product's function of
communication error or failure detection, and do not involve collection or
processing of any personal information or communication data of users.
● Reliability design declaration
Network planning and site design must comply with reliability design
principles and provide device- and solution-level protection. Device-level
protection includes planning principles of dual-network and inter-board dual-
link to avoid single point or single link of failure. Solution-level protection
refers to a fast convergence mechanism, such as FRR and VRRP. If solution-
level protection is used, ensure that the primary and backup paths do not
share links or transmission devices. Otherwise, solution-level protection may
fail to take effect.
Reference Standards and Protocols
To obtain reference standards and protocols, log in to Huawei official website,
search for "standard and protocol compliance list", and download the
Huawei S-
Series Switch Standard and Protocol Compliance List. You need to have
permissions to access the document. For any questions, contact technical support.
