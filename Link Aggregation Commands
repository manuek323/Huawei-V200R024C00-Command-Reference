2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In most cases, a switch supports a fixed maximum number of LAGs and a fixed maximum number of member interfaces in each LAG. On the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, S6730S-S, S6735-S, you can run the assign trunk command to set the maximum number of LAGs and the maximum number of member interfaces in each LAG, implementing flexible networking and meeting various service requirements.

Precautions

    By default, if the value of member-number configured for an Eth-Trunk using the assign trunk { trunk-group group-number | trunk-member member-number }* command is larger than or equal to 16 on the S6735-S or larger than 32 on the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S, known unicast packets are load balanced using the enhanced mode, and broadcast, unknown-unicast, and multicast (BUM) packets are load balanced based on their source and destination MAC addresses. Known unicast packets must be load balanced using the enhanced mode (the load balancing mode can be configured using the load-balance command). Otherwise, packet loss or uneven load balancing may occur.

    After the Eth-Trunk specifications are modified, save the configuration and restart the switch to make the modification take effect. The assign trunk command is not recorded in the configuration file. You can run the display trunk configuration command to check the number of LAGs supported by the device and the number of member interfaces in each LAG.

    If you use the assign trunk command to modify Eth-Trunk specifications, the existing Eth-Trunk configuration will become invalid or be lost. Exercise caution when you run the assign trunk command. When the configured Eth-Trunk specifications are reduced and the Eth-Trunks that exceed the specifications are configured, the configuration of excess Eth-Trunks is invalid.

    If an Eth-Trunk interface has been created on a switch and you want to expand the Eth-Trunk specifications, you need to run the load-balance enhanced profile command to configure an enhanced load balancing profile for all Eth-Trunks first. After Eth-Trunk specifications are expanded, you are advised not to delete the configured enhanced load balancing profile because this operation will cause uneven load balancing.
    After the reset netconf db-configuration or reset saved-configuration command is run, the assign trunk command configuration is cleared, that is, the default configuration is restored.

Example

# Set the maximum number of LAGs to 64 and the maximum number of member interfaces in each LAG to 16.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] assign trunk trunk-group 64 trunk-member 16

collect forward-path
Function

The collect forward-path command configures the device to collect traffic information.

The undo collect forward-path command configures the device not to collect traffic information.

By default, the device does not collect traffic information.

Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support this command.
Format

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The packet information contains the source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, source and destination MAC addresses, and protocol type. Traffic transmitted on each device interface contains different information. You can run this command to configure the device to collect traffic information, which helps you locate faults and understand the traffic forwarding path.

Precautions

The device can collect inbound and outbound interfaces and traffic information of a maximum of 8 flows.

In the outbound direction, traffic information collection (with the egress or both parameter specified) conflicts with a traffic policy or simplified traffic policy. If traffic information collection, traffic policy, or simplified traffic policy are configured, one of them may not take effect.

When the device restarts or an active/standby switchover occurs in a CSS, the collection information and report configured by the collect forward-path command will be deleted.

If traffic information collection is no longer required after the collection time ends, run the undo collect forward-path command to disable the device from collecting traffic information.

After the undo collect forward-path command is run, the collected traffic statistics will be deleted.
If commands for collecting statistics on traffic with the same packet information are configured and the directions in two consecutive commands are the same or overlap, only the previous command takes effect. Examples are as follows:

    Scenarios where collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 ingress interval 20 and collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 ingress interval 30 are configured in sequence: The collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 ingress interval 30 command does not take effect.
    Scenarios where collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 ingress and collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 both are configured in sequence: The collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 both command does not take effect.
    Scenarios where collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 both and collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 ingress are configured in sequence: The collect forward-path sip 10.1.1.1 dip 10.2.2.2 ingress command does not take effect.

Example

# Configure the device to collect traffic information with source IP address 10.1.1.1 and destination IP address 10.2.2.2.

1 : Monitoring level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

After configuring an Eth-Trunk on a device, you can run the display eth-trunk command to check whether the Eth-Trunk configuration is correct.

When using the display eth-trunk command, pay attention to the following points:

    If no parameter is specified, the display eth-trunk command displays the configurations of all Eth-Trunks.

    If only trunk-id is specified, the display eth-trunk command displays the configuration of a specified Eth-Trunk.

    If trunk-id and interface interface-type interface-number are specified, the configuration of member interfaces of the specified Eth-Trunk is displayed.

    If trunk-id is specified and verbose is configured, the display eth-trunk command displays detailed configuration of a specified Eth-Trunk, including the Eth-Trunk traffic statistics.

Prerequisites

The Eth-Trunk has been correctly configured. If no Eth-Trunk is configured, when you run this command, the system displays an error message.

Precautions
If there are traffic statistics about many Eth-Trunks, you are advised to specify trunk-id or interface interface-type interface-number to filter output information. Otherwise, the following problems may occur due to excessive output information:

    The displayed information is repeatedly updated, and required information cannot be located.

    The system does not respond because of long-time information traverse and search.

display lacp brief
Function

The display lacp brief command displays brief LACP information, including the LACP system priority and system ID.
Format

display lacp brief
Parameters

None
Views

All views
Default Level

1: Monitoring level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario
Devices at both ends of an Eth-Trunk compare LACP system priorities and system IDs to determine the Actor during LACP negotiation.

    By default, the LACP system priority is 32768, and the device with the smaller LACP system ID is used as the Actor.
    If LACP system priorities are changed using the lacp priority command, the device with the smaller LACP system priority is used as the Actor.

The display eth-trunk command can be used to check the LACP system priority and system ID only after an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode has been configured. This is inconvenient for network planning. To facilitate network planning, you can run the display lacp brief command to check the LACP system priority and system ID when no Eth-Trunk in LACP mode is configured.

Precautions

When two PEs join an E-Trunk, run the lacp e-trunk system-id command on the PEs to configure the same E-Trunk LACP system ID so that the CE considers the PEs to be one device. The E-Trunk LACP system ID configurations do not affect LACP system IDs of Eth-Trunks in LACP mode. The LACP system ID of an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode is the MAC address of the Ethernet interface on the device.

E-Trunk is supported by only the following models: S5720I-SI, S5735-S, S5735-S-I, S5735S-H, S5736-S, S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6720S-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S.

Default Level

1: Monitoring level
Usage Guidelines

An ID is manually allocated to an Eth-Trunk during Eth-Trunk creation. For example, the ID of Eth-Trunk 1 is 1. In addition, the device also allocates an internal number, also called the index, to each Eth-Trunk. When allocating indexes, the device traverses indexes in ascending order. The unallocated index is used as the index of an Eth-Trunk; therefore, the mapping between Eth-Trunk IDs and indexes is unordered. You can use display trunk index-map to check the mapping between Eth-Trunk IDs and indexes.
Example

# Display the mapping between Eth-Trunk IDs and internal indexes.

Usage Scenario

After an Eth-Trunk is successfully configured, you can run the display trunkmembership eth-trunk command to view the configuration of the Eth-Trunk and its member interfaces.

To monitor the status of an interface or locate an interface fault, you can use the display trunkmembership eth-trunk command to view detailed information about an Eth-Trunk and its member interfaces. The command output helps you can troubleshoot faults and check the member interface configuration.

Prerequisites

An Eth-Trunk has been correctly configured. If the Eth-Trunk is not created, the system displays an error when you run the display trunkmembership eth-trunk command.

Precautions

Before running the display trunkmembership eth-trunk command to view the configuration of the Eth-Trunk in LACP mode, ensure that the Eth-Trunk has been configured to work in LACP mode using the mode lacp command.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To improve the connection reliability and increase the bandwidth, you can use the eth-trunk command to bind multiple interfaces into an Eth-Trunk.

You can add an interface to an Eth-Trunk only after you run the interface Eth-Trunk command to create the Eth-Trunk.

An Eth-Trunk contains a maximum of 32 member interfaces on the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S, 16 member interfaces on the S5735S-H, S5736-S, and S6720S-S, and 8 member interfaces on all other models. Interfaces added to an Eth-Trunk are called member interfaces. On the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, S6730S-S, S6735-S, you can run the assign trunk command to set the value, and run the display trunk configuration command to check the configuration.

When you add an Ethernet interface to an Eth-Trunk, the interface must use default settings of some attributes. Otherwise, the interface cannot be added to the Eth-Trunk. The attributes include:

    Link type
    VLAN that the interface belongs to
    VLAN mapping
    VLAN stacking
    QinQ protocol number
    Interface priority
    Whether the interface allows BPDUs to pass through
    MAC address learning
    Adding the interface to a multicast group statically
    Discarding broadcast packets
    Discarding unknown multicast packets
    Discarding unknown unicast packets
    Controllable multicast profile bound to the interface

The attributes on all member interfaces of an Eth-Trunk must be consistent and cannot be changed separately. If the preceding attributes of an Eth-Trunk are changed, the attributes of all the member interfaces are changed accordingly.

It is recommended that you run the shutdown (interface view) command to disable an interface before adding the interface to an Eth-Trunk. After adding interfaces at both ends of a link to an Eth-Trunk, run the undo shutdown (interface view) command to enable the interfaces. Otherwise, traffic interruption or broadcast storms may occur.

It is recommended that you run the shutdown (interface view) command to disable a member interface before running the undo eth-trunk command to remove the member interface from an Eth-Trunk.

The number of member interfaces of the Eth-Trunk on devices at both ends must be the same. The interfaces at both ends must be connected with straight-through cables.

eth-trunk load-balance mpls-l2-switched ip enable
Function

The eth-trunk load-balance mpls-l2-switched ip enable command configures an Eth-Trunk on an L2VPN transparent transmission node to perform load balancing based on the inner source and destination IP addresses of MPLS packets.

The undo eth-trunk load-balance mpls-l2-switched ip enable command restores the default load balancing mode of MPLS packets on an L2VPN transparent transmission node.

By default, an Eth-Trunk on an L2VPN transparent transmission node performs load balancing based on the outer source and destination IP addresses of MPLS packets.

Only the following models support this function: S5731-H, S5731S-H, S5732-H, S5731-S, S5731S-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, S6730S-S.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In an L2VPN Eth-Trunk scenario, a transparent transmission node can load balance MPLS packets only based on the outer source and destination IP addresses of MPLS labels by default. To load balance MPLS packets based on the inner IP addresses of MPLS labels, run the eth-trunk load-balance mpls-l2-switched ip enable command.

Prerequisites

The load balancing mode of MPLS packets has been set to sip or dip in the load balancing profile for enhanced load balancing.

Precautions

After the eth-trunk load-balance mpls-l2-switched ip enable command is run on an L2VPN transparent transmission node, load balancing can be performed based on the inner IP addresses of labels. This command takes effect only on the L2VPN transparent transmission node. An Eth-Trunk on a P node or the egress node of a tunnel performs load balancing based on the load balancing mode specified in the load balancing profile for enhanced load balancing.

Follow-up Procedure

The corresponding Eth-Trunk interface must be bound to the load balancing profile for enhanced load balancing configured in Prerequisites.
Example

# Configure Eth-Trunk 1 to perform load balancing based on the inner source and destination IP addresses in MPLS packets.

At most 64 Eth-Trunks in LACP mode can be added to an E-Trunk.

Precautions

    Only Eth-Trunk interfaces in LACP mode can be added to an E-Trunk.

    After an Eth-Trunk interface is added to an E-Trunk, to add the Eth-Trunk interface to another E-Trunk or modify the remote Eth-Trunk ID, first run the undo e-trunk command to delete the Eth-Trunk interface from the current E-Trunk and then run the e-trunk command.

    If the master Eth-Trunk interface in an E-Trunk encounters a link failure, the backup Eth-Trunk interface goes Down after the master Eth-Trunk interface is removed from the E-Trunk.

Usage Guidelines

The e-trunk mode command is valid only for the Eth-Trunks added to an E-Trunk. When the Eth-Trunk is deleted from the E-Trunk, the configuration is cancelled.

When the E-Trunk works properly, changing the interval for sending packets or timeout of hello packets will cause the E-Trunk to alternate between the master state and the backup state. You are advised to set the working mode of a member Eth-Trunk to forcible master/backup before changing the interval for sending packets or the timeout of hello packets. After the new configuration takes effect, restore the working mode to automatic.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

E-Trunk is a Huawei proprietary protocol. UDP port 1025 used to send and receive E-Trunk packets may conflict with the UDP port used by another protocol. To ensure that E-Trunk packets are forwarded correctly, run the e-trunk port command to change the UDP port number used to send and receive E-Trunk packets.

Precautions

The port numbers at both ends of an E-Trunk must be consistent. When the E-Trunk works properly, you must change the UDP port number within the timeout of E-Trunk negotiation.

If you change the UDP port number during E-Trunk running, devices at both ends of an E-Trunk may be unable to communicate. If E-Trunk negotiation times out, both devices in the E-Trunk may become master devices.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

PE1 and PE2 are connected through an E-Trunk. PE1 is in master state and PE2 is in slave state. When PE1 fails and PE2 does not receive any E-Trunk protocol packets from PE1 after the timer expires, PE2 switches from the slave state to the master state.

The status of PE2 changes after the timer expires. During the timeout, user traffic is interrupted. To enable PE2 to rapidly detect the fault and switch its status, run this command to bind a BFD session to an E-Trunk.

After the BFD session is bound to the E-Trunk, the BFD session can rapidly detect the link between PE1 and PE2. If the link fails, the BFD session becomes Down. PE2 then can detect the BFD session status and switch its status to master so that traffic is correctly forwarded.

In this scenario, the Eth-Trunk on PE1 and PE2 supports only one member interface.

Prerequisites
Before using this command, pay attention to the following points:

    An E-Trunk and a BFD session must have been configured. BFD for IP must be used; otherwise, the E-Trunk cannot rapidly detect the fault through the BFD session.
    The IP addresses of both ends of the E-Trunk must be reachable; otherwise, the BFD session cannot go Up. That is, the BFD session cannot detect the link between PE1 and PE2.

Precautions

After a BFD session is bound to an E-Trunk and AC interfaces on both devices of the E-Trunk are associated with the BFD session, if the AC interface of the master device fails, the BFD session goes Down and traffic is switched to the standby link. If the AC interface recovers within 60 seconds, traffic is immediately switched back to the active link.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The default value of the CollectorMaxDelay field in LACPDUs sent by the device of different versions to the connected non-Huawei device is different. This may cause high CPU usage. You can run the lacp collector delay command to set the value of the CollectorMaxDelay field in LACPDUs.

Prerequisites

The Eth-Trunk has been configured to work in LACP mode using the mode lacp command.

Precautions

For a Huawei device, the valid value range of the CollectorMaxDelay field is 0 to 65535. Even though the member interfaces of the same Eth-Trunk receive LACPDUs with different CollectorMaxDelay values, the device can process the LACPDUs without deteriorating its CPU performance.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

The lacp e-trunk priority command sets the LACP priority of an E-Trunk. If the LACP priority is set, a member Eth-Trunk sends LACPDUs by using this LACP priority. If the LACP priority is not set, the default LACP priority 32768 is used.

The master and backup devices in an E-Trunk must use the same LACP priority.

When multiple E-Trunks are configured on the device, different LAGs can use different LACP priorities. You need to set the LACP priorities in the Eth-Trunk interface view.

The LACP priority configured in the system view is valid for all Eth-Trunks added to the E-Trunk. The LACP priority configured in the Eth-Trunk view takes effect only on the corresponding Eth-Trunk. If the LACP priorities are configured in both the Eth-Trunk interface view and system view, the LACP priority configured in the interface view takes effect.

Ensure that the Eth-Trunk has been added to the E-Trunk before you run the lacp e-trunk priority command in the Eth-Trunk interface view.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario
Figure 5-1 Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode

As shown in Figure 5-1, when no service is bound to the MA (Maintenance Association), an Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode is configured on two devices. interface1 where the MEP (Maintenance End Point) resides is the interface of the Eth-Trunk interface's primary link. When the delay-measure two-way trigger if-down or loss-measure single-ended-synthetic trigger if-down command is configured on interface1, interface1 is triggered to go ETHOAM down if Y.1731 detects that the primary link has poor quality. To ensure that services are not interrupted, run the lacp track interface command in the Eth-Trunk member interface view to increase the priority of the secondary member interface interface2. The secondary link then preempts the primary state, implementing an automatic primary/secondary link switchover.

When the primary link's quality recovers, run the lacp force-switch command to enable forcible switching if no preemption is configured or preemption is enabled but the delay is not reached.

Prerequisites

The lacp track interface command has been run to associate the secondary member interface of an Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode with its primary member interface and to dynamically change the priority of the secondary member interface.

Precautions

An Eth-Trunk interface can have only two member interfaces. The maximum number of active links must be 1.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario
Figure 5-2 A switch directly connects to a server
In Figure 5-2, two interfaces of two network adapters on a server are directly connected to a switch. The switch is configured with an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode. The process on the server is as follows:

    The server configures an IP address for Interface1 based the default configuration during startup, and sends a request to the remote file server through Interface1 and downloads the configuration file from the remote file server.
    After the configuration file is downloaded successfully, the server aggregates two interfaces according to the configuration file. The server uses the two interfaces as Eth-Trunk member interfaces to perform LACP negotiation with the switch.

Before the server obtains the configuration file, Interface1 is an independent physical interface and is not configured with LACP. As a result, LACP negotiation on the switch interface fails. The switch does not forward traffic on the Eth-Trunk, and the server cannot download the configuration file through Interface1. In this case, the server cannot communicate with the switch.

To address this issue, run the lacp force-forward command on the Eth-Trunk of the switch. The Eth-Trunk member interface in Up state can still forward data packets even though the remote device is not enabled with LACP.

Prerequisites

The Eth-Trunk has been configured to work in LACP mode by using the mode lacp command.

Precautions

    With this command configured, an Eth-Trunk interface does not support Layer 3 forwarding and cannot be used to forward packets sent to the CPU. Only member interfaces in the ForceFwd state can forward Layer 2 traffic through hardware forwarding. The ForceFwd state is automatically set when LACP negotiation fails, and cannot be changed manually. You can use the display eth-trunk command to check the value of the Status field.
    This command applies to only the scenario where an Eth-Trunk joins a VLAN as an access, hybrid, trunk, and dot1q-tunnel interfaces.
    When a spanning tree protocol (for example, STP, RSTP, or MSTP) is used, the member interface in ForceFwd state cannot be blocked. That is, the member interface in ForceFwd state can continue to forward data packets. When other loop prevention protocols such as ERPS and RRPP are used, the member interface in ForceFwd state can be blocked. The blocked member interface in ForceFwd state cannot forward data packets.
    This command cannot be used with E-Trunk. That is, this command cannot be used on the Eth-Trunk that joins an E-Trunk.
    This command cannot be used with max active-linknumber or least active-linknumber.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

When the working mode of an Eth-Trunk interface is set to LACP, Eth-Trunk member interfaces are configured to forward traffic after LACP negotiation and instruct services to reselect a route. Service traffic then can be properly forwarded. However, when multiple cards are restarted at the same time, Eth-Trunk member interfaces negotiate in preemption mode. As a result, Eth-Trunk member interfaces negotiate slowly, causing a large number of service packets to be lost.

After optimized LACP convergence is enabled using the lacp optimized-converge enable command, the device increases the LACP negotiation priority so that services can quickly detect Eth-Trunk member interface changes, accelerating Eth-Trunk traffic convergence.
Example

# Enable optimized LACP convergence.

Usage Guidelines

To use this command, ensure that the following conditions are met:

    The Eth-Trunk has been configured to work in LACP mode using the mode lacp command in the Eth-Trunk interface view.
    Priority preemption has been enabled on the Eth-Trunk using the lacp preempt enable command in the Eth-Trunk interface view.

Link A replaces link B and becomes active after the preemption delay n the following situation:

    LACP priority preemption is enabled and the lacp preempt delay command is used.
    The faulty link (link A) with higher priority than that of the current active link (link B) recovers.
    The number of current active links reaches the upper threshold.

If both devices of an Eth-Trunk use different preemption delays, a longer preemption delay is used. If priority preemption is enabled but the preemption delay is not set, the interface with a higher priority preempts the interface with a lower priority according to the default preemption delay.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenarios

In LACP mode, when one of the active links fails, the system selects the link with the highest priority from backup links to replace the faulty one. When the faulty link recovers, the priority of this link is higher than the priority of the link that replaces itself, and priority preemption is enabled, the link becomes active again.

If priority preemption is disabled, the system does not re-select any active interface. The recovered link functions as the backup one.

When priority preemption is enabled, the system selects an active interface based on the LACP interface priority on the Actor.

Prerequisites

The LACP mode must have been configured using the mode lacp command in the Eth-Trunk interface view.

Precautions

To ensure that an Eth-Trunk works properly, enable or disable LACP preemption on both ends of the Eth-Trunk.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The LACP system priority is used to differentiate the local device and the remote device. The device of a higher LACP system priority is selected as the Actor of the link aggregate group (LAG), and active interfaces are selected according to interfaces of the Actor.

The LACP interface priority is used to differentiate interfaces on a device. The interface of a higher priority is selected as the active interface.

If devices at both ends of an Eth-Trunk are not configured with LACP system priorities, the devices use the default LACP system priority 32768 and the device with a smaller MAC address is selected as the Actor.

If priorities of different interfaces on a switch are not set, the default priority of interfaces is all 32768. Active interfaces are selected based on interface numbers and interfaces with smaller interface numbers are preferred.

Prerequisites

The interface has been added to the Eth-Trunk in LACP mode.

You can run the mode lacp command in the Eth-Trunk interface view to change the working mode of an Eth-Trunk to LACP.

Precautions

In LACP mode, active interfaces selected by devices at both ends of an Eth-Trunk link must be the same; otherwise, the link aggregation group cannot be set up.

If the max active-linknumber command is executed in LACP mode to set the upper threshold for the number of active interfaces, you need to determine the active interfaces when the number of interfaces manually added to an LAG exceeds the upper threshold. Setting the LACP interface priority ensures that interfaces with higher priorities become active ones in LACP mode.

If the max active-linknumber command is not used, the upper threshold for the number of active interfaces is 8. When the number of interfaces manually added to an LAG is smaller than 8, you do not need to select active interfaces because all interfaces are active.

If the max active-linknumber link-number command is run in the Eth-Trunk interface view, you need to run the lacp preempt enable command to enable LACP preemption on the current Eth-Trunk interface. Otherwise, interfaces with high LACP priorities may fail to be selected as active interfaces.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

A change in the LACP system priority will cause LACP renegotiation. During the renegotiation process, Eth-Trunk interfaces in LACP mode will go Down until the renegotiation succeeds, which may interrupt services. If the lacp priority command used to set the LACP interface priority is executed in the system view, the Eth-Trunk in LACP mode may alternate between Up and Down. To prevent this situation, run the lacp priority-command-mode command in the system view to set the configuration mode of the LACP system priority to system-priority. This mode can be used to differentiate the LACP system priority and LACP interface priority.

Precautions
When running the lacp priority-command-mode command, note the following points:

    If you specify default in the command, the LACP system priority and LACP interface priority configurations still use the same command (lacp priority priority).
    If you specify system-priority in the command, run the lacp system-priority priority command to configure the LACP system priority and run the lacp priority priority command to configure the LACP interface priority.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

As defined in LACP, active interfaces are selected based on the LACP interface priority by default. If member interfaces of an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode work at different rates, low-speed interfaces may be selected as active interfaces. To enable the device to select high-speed interfaces as active interfaces, run the lacp selected command to set the mode of selecting active interfaces to speed.

To enable the device to select active interface based on the LACP interface priority, run the lacp selected priority command to set the mode of selecting active interfaces to priority.

Prerequisites

The Eth-Trunk has been configured to work in LACP mode using the mode lacp command in the Eth-Trunk interface view.

Precautions

Active interfaces are selected based on the LACP interface priority by default. Changing the mode for selecting active interfaces may cause service interruptions for a short time. You are advised not to change the mode for selecting active interfaces during service transmission.

You are advised not to bundle interfaces working at different rates into an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode because the priority preemption function may become ineffective.

Usage Guidelines

When a Huawei device connects to a non-Huawei device through Eth-Trunk interfaces in static LACP mode, if the Huawei device uses the default system MAC address, whereas the non-Huawei device uses the MAC addresses of the Eth-Trunk member interfaces as LACPDUs' source MAC addresses, the non-Huawei device may consider the received LACPDUs with the same MAC address invalid and therefore discard them, leading to an LACP negotiation failure.

To ensure a successful LACP negotiation, run the lacp src-mac port command to configure the Huawei device to use interface MAC addresses as LACPDUs' source MAC addresses.

The value is in the format of H-H-H. Each H is a 4-digit hexadecimal number. You can enter 1 to 4 digits, such as 00e0 or fc01. If an H contains fewer than four digits, 0s are added ahead. For example, e0 is equal to 00e0.
NOTE:

The LACP system ID of an Eth-Trunk cannot be all 0s.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When multiple E-Trunks are configured on the device, the link aggregation groups can use different LACP system IDs. You need to run the lacp system-id mac-address command to set the LACP system ID.

The LACP system ID configured using the lacp e-trunk system-id command in the system view is valid for all Eth-Trunks that are added to the E-Trunk. The LACP system ID configured using the lacp system-id mac-address command in the Eth-Trunk interface view is valid for only the Eth-Trunk. If the LACP system ID is configured in both the Eth-Trunk interface view and system view, the system ID configured in the Eth-Trunk interface view takes effect.

Prerequisites

The Eth-Trunk has been configured to work in LACP mode using the mode lacp command.
Example
# Configure 00e0-fc00-0000 as the LACP system ID of Eth-Trunk 10.

<HUAWEI> system-view

lacp system-priority
Function

The lacp system-priority command configures a Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) system priority.

The undo lacp system-priority command restores the default LACP system priority.

The default LACP system priority is 32768.
Format

Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value
priority 	Specifies an LACP system priority. 	The value is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535. A smaller value indicates a higher LACP priority.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The system priority is set to differentiate the priority of the local device and the peer device. The system of a higher priority is selected as the Actor of the link aggregate group (LAG), and active interfaces are selected according to interfaces of the Actor.

If the devices on both ends of the Eth-Trunk are not configured with system priorities, the devices use the default priority 32768. In this case, the Actor is selected according to the system MAC. The system with a smaller MAC is selected as the Actor.

A change in the LACP system priority will cause LACP renegotiation. During the renegotiation process, Eth-Trunk interfaces in LACP mode will go Down until the renegotiation succeeds, which may interrupt services. If the lacp priority command used to set the LACP interface priority is executed in the system view, the Eth-Trunk in LACP mode may alternate between Up and Down. To prevent this situation, run the lacp priority-command-mode command in the system view to set the configuration mode of the LACP system priority to system-priority. This mode can be used to differentiate the LACP system priority and LACP interface priority.
When running the lacp priority-command-mode command, note the following points:

    If you specify default in the command, the LACP system priority and LACP interface priority configurations still use the same command (lacp priority priority).
    If you specify system-priority in the command, run the lacp system-priority priority command to configure the LACP system priority and run the lacp priority priority command to configure the LACP interface priority.

Prerequisites

The lacp priority-command-mode system-priority command has been executed in the system view to set the configuration mode of the LACP system priority to system-priority.
Example

# Set the LACP system priority to 10.

lacp timeout
Function

The lacp timeout command configures the timeout interval for an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode to receive LACPDUs.

The undo lacp timeout command restores the default timeout interval.

By default, the timeout interval for an Eth-Trunk to receive LACPDUs is 90s.
Format

lacp timeout { fast [ user-defined user-defined ] | slow }

undo lacp timeout
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value
fast 	Indicates that the timeout interval for an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode to receive LACPDUs is 3 seconds.

If fast is specified, the remote device sends an LACPDU every 1 second. In this mode, the local device can quickly respond to LACPDUs from the remote device but consumes more system resources compared with the slow mode.
	-
user-defined user-defined 	

Specifies the timeout interval for an Eth-Trunk to receive LACPDUs when fast is specified.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 3 to 90, in seconds.
slow 	Indicates that the timeout interval for an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode to receive LACPDUs is 90 seconds.

If slow is specified, the remote device sends an LACPDU every 30 seconds. In this mode, the local device responds to LACPDUs from the remote device slowly but consumes fewer system resources compared with the fast mode.

The timeout interval on the two ends can be different. To facilitate maintenance, you are advised to set the same timeout interval at both ends.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If two devices are connected through three GE interfaces at each end and the three GE interfaces are bundled into an Eth-Trunk, you can run the mode lacp command to configure the Eth-Trunk to work in LACP mode and run the least active-linknumber link-number command to set the lower threshold for the number of active interfaces to 2.

If the Eth-Trunk on the local device cannot detect a self-loop or fault that occurred on a member interface in the LAG on the remote device, the local Eth-Trunk still has three member interfaces in Up state and the three member interfaces still load balance data, causing packet loss. To ensure reliable data transmission, run the lacp timeout command to set the timeout interval for the Eth-Trunk to receive LACPDUs. If a local member interface does not receive any LACPDU within the configured timeout interval, it becomes Down immediately and no longer forwards data.

The number of Up member interfaces does not fall below the configured lower threshold for the number of active interfaces, so the Eth-Trunk is still Up. In this case, data is load balanced between the two member interfaces in Up state and reliably transmitted to the remote end.

Prerequisites

The Eth-Trunk has been configured to work in LACP mode using the mode lacp command in the Eth-Trunk interface view.

Precautions

After the timeout interval is successfully configured, pay attention to the following points:

    If fast is specified, the remote device sends an LACPDU every 1 second.
    If slow is specified, the remote device sends an LACPDU every 30 seconds.

The timeout interval configured on an Eth-Trunk takes effect on all its member interfaces.

Usage Scenario
Figure 5-3 Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode

As shown in Figure 5-3, when no service is bound to the MA, an Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode is configured on two devices. interface1 where the MEP resides is the interface of the Eth-Trunk interface's primary link. When the delay-measure two-way trigger if-down or loss-measure single-ended-synthetic trigger if-down command is configured on interface1, interface1 is triggered to go ETHOAM down if Y.1731 detects that the primary link has poor quality.

To ensure that services are not interrupted, run the lacp track interface command in the Eth-Trunk member interface view to increase the priority of the secondary member interface interface2. The secondary link then preempts the primary state, implementing an automatic primary/secondary link switchover.

Prerequisites

An Eth-Trunk interface has been configured to work in LACP mode using the mode lacp command in the Eth-Trunk interface view.

Precautions

An Eth-Trunk interface can have only two member interfaces. The maximum number of active links must be 1.

The lacp track interface command must be configured on the secondary member interface of an Eth-Trunk interface's Actor.

The secondary member interface must not be associated with another interface.

If the lacp track interface command has been run and the primary link has poor quality, the primary interface is triggered to go ETHOAM down. If the secondary link also has poor quality, a primary/secondary switchover is also performed because Y.1731 performance detection is not configured for the secondary link.

If the lacp track interface command has been run and the primary link has poor quality, the primary interface is triggered to go ETHOAM down. If the undo lacp track interface command is run to delete the configuration, two links cannot be selected within the timeout period. As a result, traffic is interrupted. Services can be restored only after the timeout period elapses.
Example
# Associate the secondary member interface GE 0/0/1 of an Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode with its primary member interface GE 0/0/2, and set a value by which the priority is reduced to 100 when the status of the primary member interface changes to ETHOAM down.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The number of active interfaces in an Eth-Trunk affects the status and bandwidth of the Eth-Trunk. The bandwidth of an Eth-Trunk is equal to the total bandwidth of all member interfaces in Up state.

The number of Up member links affects the status and bandwidth of an Eth-Trunk. To ensure that the Eth-Trunk functions properly and is less affected by member link status changes, set the following thresholds.

    Lower threshold for the number of active interfaces

    When the number of active interfaces falls below this threshold, the Eth-Trunk goes Down. This guarantees the Eth-Trunk a minimum available bandwidth.

    For example, if the Eth-Trunk is required to provide a minimum bandwidth of 2 Gbit/s and each member link's bandwidth is 1 Gbit/s, the lower threshold for the number of active interfaces must be set to 2 or larger.

    Upper threshold for the number of active interfaces

    When the number of active interfaces reaches this threshold, the bandwidth of the Eth-Trunk will not increase even if more member links go Up. This guarantees higher network reliability.

    To set the upper threshold for the number of active interfaces, use the max active-linknumber command.

To delete the configured lower threshold or restore the default lower threshold, use the undo least active-linknumber or least active-linknumber 1 command.

Prerequisites

The Eth-Trunk has been correctly configured.

Precautions

If you run the least active-linknumber command multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect.

After the lower threshold for the number of active interfaces is configured, the following situations may occur:

    The Eth-Trunk goes Down when the number of active interfaces falls below the configured lower threshold.

    The Eth-Trunk goes Up when the number of active interfaces reaches the configured lower threshold.

If the max active-linknumber command has been configured before you run the least active-linknumber command, ensure that the lower threshold for the number of active interfaces is less than or equal to the upper threshold for the number of active interfaces.

# Set the lower threshold for the number of active interfaces to 3.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To ensure proper load balancing between physical links of an Eth-Trunk and avoid link congestion, use the load-balance command to set the load balancing mode of the Eth-Trunk.

Load balancing is valid only for outgoing traffic; therefore, the load balancing modes for the interfaces at both ends of the link can be different and do not affect each other.

You can set the load balancing mode based on traffic models. When a parameter of traffic changes frequently, you can set the load balancing mode based on this parameter to ensure that the traffic is load balanced evenly. For example, if IP addresses in packets change frequently, use the load balancing mode based on dst-ip, src-ip, or src-dst-ip so that traffic can be properly load balanced among physical links. If MAC addresses in packets change frequently and IP addresses are fixed, use the load balancing mode based on dst-mac, src-mac, or src-dst-mac so that traffic can be properly load balanced among physical links.

After the load-balance command is run to configure the load balancing mode for an Eth-Trunk, the hash factors used to calculate the outbound interface vary according to the packet type and device model. For example, after you configure load balancing based on the source and destination IP addresses for an Eth-Trunk, Layer 2 packets are load balanced automatically based on the source and destination MAC addresses because Layer 2 packets do not contain the source and destination IP addresses. You can run the display eth-trunk load-balance command to check the hash factors used when the outbound interface is calculated.

Prerequisites

Ensure that the load-balance-profile profile-name command has been executed to create a load balancing profile before you run the load-balance enhanced profile profile-name command.

Precautions

If you run the load-balance command multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect.

When an inter-device Eth-Trunk is configured in a stack and the local device has Eth-Trunk member interfaces and the member interfaces function properly, only the Eth-Trunk member interfaces on the local device participate in load balancing. To enable Eth-Trunk member interfaces on other devices participate in load balancing, run the undo local-preference enable command to configure the Eth-Trunk not to preferentially forward local traffic.

When more than 128 Eth-Trunks, or more than 16 member interfaces are configured using the assign trunk { trunk-group group-number | trunk-member member-number }* command, only the enhanced mode can be used for load balancing. If the enhanced mode is not used, problems such as packet loss and uneven load balancing may occur.

If the value of member-number configured for an Eth-Trunk using the assign trunk { trunk-group group-number | trunk-member member-number }* command is larger than 16 on the S6735-S or larger than 32 on the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S, only the enhanced mode can be used for load balancing. If the enhanced mode is not used, problems such as packet loss and uneven load balancing may occur.

The SS1720GW-E, S1720GWR-E, S5720I-SI, S5720-LI, S5720S-LI, S5735S-H, S5736-S, and S6720S-S use the src-dst-ip, source TCP or UDP port number, and destination TCP or UDP port number in the hash algorithm for load balancing regardless of whether you configure this parameter.

The S1720GW-E, S1720GWR-E, S5720I-SI, S5720-LI, S2730S-S, S5735-L-I, S5735-L1,S300, S5735-L, S5735S-L1, S5720S-LI, S5735-S, S500, S5735-S-I, S5735S-H, S5736-S, and S6720S-S support only one load balancing mode globally. If the load balancing mode of an Eth-Trunk is modified, the modification takes effect on all Eth-Trunks. If an Eth-Trunk is created, the load balancing mode of the Eth-Trunk is the same as that of the original Eth-Trunks on the switch.

On the S6735-S, when the load-balance command is run to configure the load balancing mode for an Eth-Trunk, whether the TCP or UDP port number is involved in the hash operation depends on the ecmp load-balance command. If the default setting is used or the port parameter is specified in the ecmp load-balance command, the TCP or UDP port number is involved in the hash operation when the dst-ip, src-ip, or src-dst-ip load balancing mode is configured for an Eth-Trunk.

On the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-S, S5731S-H, S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S, when you run the load-balance { dst-ip | dst-mac | src-ip | src-mac | src-dst-ip | src-dst-mac } command to configure the load balancing mode for an Eth-Trunk, regardless of which parameter is specified, packets are load balanced based on physical-layer source port numbers in the packets.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In a stack, an Eth-Trunk is configured to be the outbound interface of traffic to ensure reliable transmission. Member interfaces of the Eth-Trunk may be located on different devices. When the stack device forwards traffic, the Eth-Trunk may select an inter-device member interface based on the hash algorithm. This forwarding mode occupies bandwidth resources between devices and reduces traffic forwarding efficiency.

To solve the problem, run the local-preference enable command to enable the Eth-Trunk to preferentially forward local traffic. Then traffic arriving at the local device is preferentially forwarded through member interfaces of the local device. If there is no member interface on the local device, member interfaces on another device are used to forward traffic. This forwarding mode effectively saves inter-device bandwidth resources and improves traffic forwarding efficiency.

    When the local device has Eth-Trunk member interfaces and the member interfaces function properly, the Eth-Trunk forwarding table of the local device contains only local Eth-Trunk member interfaces. Therefore, the hash algorithm selects a local member interface, and traffic is forwarded through the local device.

    When the local device does not have any Eth-Trunk member interfaces or all member interfaces fail, the Eth-Trunk forwarding table of the local device contains all available Eth-Trunk member interfaces. The hash algorithm selects a member interface on another device, and traffic is forwarded through this device.

Precaution

Member interfaces of the local Eth-Trunk have sufficient bandwidth to forward local interface traffic, which prevents packet loss.

This function is only valid for known unicast packets, and is invalid for broadcast, unknown-unicast, and multicast (BUM) packets.

max active-linknumber
Function

The max active-linknumber command sets the upper threshold for the number of active interfaces in an Eth-Trunk.

The undo max active-linknumber command restores the default upper threshold for the number of active interfaces in an Eth-Trunk.

By default, the upper threshold for the number of active interfaces in an Eth-Trunk is 32 on the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S, 16 on the S5735S-H, S5736-S, and S6720S-S, and 8 on other models.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The number of active interfaces in an Eth-Trunk affects the status and bandwidth of the Eth-Trunk. The bandwidth of an Eth-Trunk is equal to the total bandwidth of all member interfaces in Up state.

The number of Up member links affects the status and bandwidth of an Eth-Trunk. To ensure that the Eth-Trunk functions properly and is less affected by member link status changes, set the following thresholds.

    Lower threshold for the number of active interfaces

    When the number of active interfaces falls below this threshold, the Eth-Trunk goes Down. This guarantees the Eth-Trunk a minimum available bandwidth.

    For example, if the Eth-Trunk is required to provide a minimum bandwidth of 2 Gbit/s and each member link's bandwidth is 1 Gbit/s, the minimum number of Up member links must be set to 2 or larger.

    To set the lower threshold for the number of active interfaces, run the least active-linknumber command.

    Upper threshold for the number of active interfaces

    When the number of active interfaces reaches this threshold, the bandwidth of the Eth-Trunk will not increase even if more member links go Up. The upper threshold is used to improve network reliability with assured bandwidth.

Prerequisites

The Eth-Trunk has been correctly configured.

Precautions

    If you run the max active-linknumber command multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect.

    The max active-linknumber command is valid only in LACP mode.

    If the number of member interfaces added to an Eth-Trunk is less than the upper threshold, there is no backup interface.

    After you run this command, if the number of current active interfaces reaches the upper threshold, new member interfaces function as the backup interfaces.

    If the least active-linknumber command has been configured before you run the max active-linknumber command, ensure that the maximum number of active member links is greater than or equal to the minimum number of active member links.

    The upper thresholds configured by the max active-linknumber command on both ends must be the same; otherwise, the Eth-Trunk status flaps if an active interface fails.
    In the scenario where the Eth-Trunk in 1:N LACP mode is used, the upper threshold for the number of Eth-Trunk member links in Up state is 1. After the active link becomes Down and before the backup link switches to the active link, the Down event of the original active link is not reported to the Eth-Trunk. To prevent route re-calculation caused by the Eth-Trunk Down event, the Down event of the original active link is reported to the Eth-Trunk in any of the following situations:
        The timeout interval (60s) for reporting the Down event has been expired.
        The backup link goes Up and becomes the active link.
        The backup link fails and cannot go Up.
    The preceding implementation is inapplicable to scenarios where association between Eth-Trunk in E-Trunk or LACP mode and VRRP is configured.

    When a Huawei switch connects to a non-Huawei device, if the maximum number of active links at both ends is smaller than the number of all active interfaces of the Eth-Trunk, a link is interrupted suddenly especially in 1:1 mode. As a result, LACP negotiation results at both ends are different and the Eth-Trunk in Down state cannot be restored. It is recommended that LACP preemption be enabled and the same preemption delay be set at both ends or the maximum number of active links be not set at both ends.

    The 1:1 mode indicates that the maximum number of active links at both ends of an Eth-Trunk is 1 and two member interfaces join an Eth-Trunk at both ends.

# Set the upper threshold for the number of active interfaces in Eth-Trunk 1 to 3.

mixed-rate link enable
Function

The mixed-rate link enable command adds interfaces with different interface types to the same Eth-Trunk.

The undo mixed-rate link enable command disables interfaces with different interface types from being added to the same Eth-Trunk.

By default, interfaces with different interface types are not allowed to be added to the same Eth-Trunk.

Parameters

Eth-Trunk interface view
Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

You can run the mixed-rate link enable command to add interfaces with different rates to the same Eth-Trunk. If a member interface of an Eth-Trunk is a GE interface and the transmission bandwidth needs to be increased, you can enable this function when the GE interface needs to be changed to an XGE interface. During switching, add the XGE interface to the Eth-Trunk and then delete the GE interface. In this way, the service interruption time during the switching process can be reduced.

Precautions

    In LACP mode, if the peer device does not support this function, interfaces with different rates cannot be successfully added to the same Eth-Trunk even if the local device has the function enabled.
    In LACP mode, when Eth-Trunk negotiation succeeds, modifying the configuration of this command triggers a renegotiation, which can cause an LACP flap.
    In manual mode, if the peer device allows only interfaces with the same rate to be added to the same Eth-Trunk, traffic forwarded by all interfaces of the local device can be received only by the interfaces with the same rate, but not by the other interfaces.
    When an Eth-Trunk performs load balancing calculation, the interface rate cannot be used as the calculation weight. When interfaces with different rates are added to the same Eth-Trunk, traffic is evenly load balanced on all the links. Therefore, the bandwidth of member interfaces is calculated by the minimum rate of the member interfaces in the Eth-Trunk. For example, when a GE interface and a 10GE interface are added to the same Eth-Trunk, the rate of the GE interface is used in calculation and the bandwidth of the Eth-Trunk is 2G.
    When the undo mixed-rate link enable command is executed, ensure that the Eth-Trunk does not contain member interfaces with different rates.

# Set the Eth-Trunk 2 to allow interfaces with different interface types adding.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenarios
An Eth-Trunk can use the following working modes:

    LACP mode

    When the devices that are directly connected through an Eth-Trunk support LACP, you can run the mode lacp command to configure the Eth-Trunk to work in LACP mode. This mode can implement both load balancing and redundancy.

    In LACP mode, you must manually create an Eth-Trunk and add member interfaces to the Eth-Trunk. The difference between the LACP mode and manual load balancing mode is that active member interfaces are selected by sending LACP data units (LACPDUs). That is, when a group of interfaces are added to an Eth-Trunk, devices at both ends determine active and inactive interfaces by sending LACPDUs to each other.

    Manual load balancing mode

    When one of the devices at the two ends of an Eth-Trunk does not support LACP, run the mode manual load-balance command to configure the Eth-Trunk to work in manual load balancing mode. In addition, you can add multiple member interfaces to the Eth-Trunk to increase the bandwidth between the two devices and improve reliability.

    The manual load balancing mode is a basic link aggregation mode. In this mode, you must manually create an Eth-Trunk and add interfaces to the Eth-Trunk. LACP is not used.

    In manual load balancing mode, all active interfaces of the Eth-Trunk forward data and load balance traffic.

Precautions

If you run the mode command multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect.

If an Eth-Trunk interface has member interfaces, you can switch the Eth-Trunk interface's working mode between manual mode and LACP mode. However, if the Eth-Trunk interface is added to an E-Trunk, you cannot change its working mode.
Example

# Configure Eth-Trunk 1 to work in LACP mode.

Usage Scenario

The undo mpls field command with no parameter specified restores the default load balancing modes of MPLS packets. The undo mpls field command with a parameter specified deletes a specified load balancing mode of MPLS packets.

The mpls field 3rd-label command implements flow label-based load balancing on L2VPN networks.

Precautions

    If you run the mpls field command multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect.

    Only the S5731-H, S5731S-H, S5732-H, S6730S-H, and S6730-H support the 3rd-label, l4-dport, l4-sport, and protocol load balancing mode.

    Only 2nd-label, dmac, smac, sport, and top-label are supported on the S5735S-H, S5736-S, and S6720S-S.

    Load balancing based on MPLS labels takes effect for only labeled packets on the ingress.
    For the S5731-H, S5731S-H, S5732-H, S5731-S, S5731S-S, S6730-S, S6730S-S, S6730S-H, and S6730-H, MPLS packets can be load balanced based on source or destination IP addresses on the P and tunnel egress on an L2VPN network. If original data packets are Layer 2 packets and the sip or dip parameter is specified, MPLS packets are load balanced based on source or destination MAC addresses. For other models, load balancing based on source or destination IP addresses for MPLS packets does not take effect on the P and tunnel egress on an L2VPN network. You are advised to configure the 2nd-label, 3rd-label, or top-label load balancing mode.

Usage Scenario

Before collecting statistics about LACPDUs on a specific interface within a given period of time, you need to run the reset lacp statistics eth-trunk command to clear the existing statistics about LACPDUs on the interface.

When using the reset lacp statistics eth-trunk command, pay attention to the following points:

    If no parameter is specified, statistics about LACPDUs on all Eth-Trunks in LACP mode are cleared.

    If only trunk-id is specified, statistics about LACPDUs on the specified Eth-Trunk in LACP mode are cleared.

    If both trunk-id and interface interface-type interface-number are specified, statistics about LACPDUs on the specified member interface of the specified Eth-Trunk in LACP mode are cleared.

Prerequisites

    The Eth-Trunk has been created and configured to work in LACP mode.

    Member interfaces have been added to the Eth-Trunk.

Precautions

The reset lacp statistics eth-trunk command clears statistics about sent and received LACPDUs on all Eth-Trunks in LACP mode, a specified Eth-Trunk in LACP mode, or a specified member interface. The cleared statistics cannot be restored. Exercise caution when you run this command.

Usage Guidelines

The timer hello command sets the interval at which the master and backup devices of an E-Trunk send hello packet. If the backup device receives no hello packet from the master device after certain number of intervals (specified by the timer hold-on-failure multiplier command for detecting hello packets), the backup device becomes the master.

Configuring a timeout period longer than 5 minutes is recommended, so that the Eth-Trunk packets can be sent to the peer device within the timeout period when a master/backup switchover is performed.
Example

# Set the interval for sending hello packets to 9.

timer hold-on-failure multiplier
Function

The timer hold-on-failure multiplier command sets the time multiplier for an E-Trunk to detect hello packets.

The undo timer hold-on-failure multiplier command restores the default time multiplier.

By default, the time multiplier for detecting hello packets is 20.

Only the S5720I-SI, S5735-S, S5735-S-I, S5735S-H, S5736-S, S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6720S-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support this command.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

After the time multiplier for detecting hello packets is set, the local device is triggered to send hello packets. The remote device checks the timeout of the local device according to the timeout interval in the received packet. If the remote device is the backup device and does not receive hello packets from the local device within the timeout interval, the remote device becomes the master device.

Timeout interval = Interval for sending hello packets x Time multiplier

It is recommended that you set the time multiplier to 3 or larger.

The timeout interval configured on the local device is used by the remote device to check the timeout of the local device. If the hello packet from the remote device does not contain the timeout interval, the timeout interval of the local device is used.
Example

# Set the time multiplier for detecting hello packets to 3.

timer revert delay
Function

The timer revert delay command sets the revertive switching delay of an E-Trunk.

The undo timer revert delay command restores the default revertive switching delay of an E-Trunk.

By default, the revertive switching delay of an E-Trunk is 120 seconds.

Only the S5720I-SI, S5735-S, S5735-S-I, S5735S-H, S5736-S, S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6720S-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support this command.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When the member Eth-Trunk on the master device goes Down, the member Eth-Trunk on the remote device becomes Up after LACP negotiation. Then the remote device becomes the master device, and the local device becomes the backup device. When the local device recovers, it becomes the master device again in the subsequent LACP negotiation.

If an E-Trunk works with other services, after the master device recovers from a fault, the status of the member Eth-Trunk on the master device may be restored before other services are restored. If traffic is immediately switched back to the master device, service traffic will be interrupted. To solve this problem, you need to set the revertive switching delay for the E-Trunk.

After you run the timer revert delay command to set the revertive switching delay for an E-Trunk, the local Eth-Trunk can become Up only after the delay timer times out. This delays the revertive switching of the service traffic, ensuring nonstop services.

Precautions

The revert delay of an E-Trunk must be greater than the PW recovery time. This ensures that services are not interrupted when traffic is reverted back to the master device.

In E-Trunk B2B scenarios where there are four PE devices and an E-Trunk is configured between each two PEs, to ensure that services can be switched back to the master device when a fault is rectified, configure the master device in one E-Trunk to immediately switch traffic back and the master device in the other E-Trunk to switch traffic back after a delay.

# Set the revertive switching delay of E-Trunk 1 to 100 seconds.

Usage Guidelines

If the traffic policy contains a traffic behavior that defines the action of re-marking destination MAC addresses of packets, load balancing of BUM traffic must be based on source MAC addresses of packets.

On a VPLS network or a VXLAN network, when the S6735-S switche form a stack, if the outbound interface of BUM traffic is an inter-device Eth-Trunk interface, you need to configure run the unknown-unicast load-balance enhanced lbid to configure the load balancing mode. Otherwise, packet loss may occur or there may be duplicate packets.
Example

# Configure the device to load balance BUM traffic based on source MAC addresses of packets.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

When configuring enhanced Eth-Trunk load balancing, you can run the unicast load-balance enhanced command to configure known unicast packets, such as GRE packets, to be load balanced based on the inner IP address, outer IP address, or both.

    In IPv4 over GRE or IPv6 over GRE scenarios, if inner-ip is specified, known unicast packets are load balanced based on the inner source IP address, inner destination IP address, or both. Similarly, you can configure known unicast packets to be load balanced based on the outer source IP address, outer destination IP address, or both. Additionally, known unicast packets can be load balanced based on the inner and outer source IP addresses, inner and outer destination IP addresses, or both.
    In Ethernet over GRE scenarios, if inner-ip is specified, known unicast packets are load balanced based on the inner source MAC address, inner destination MAC address, or both. If outer-ip is specified, known unicast packets are load balanced based on the outer source IP address, outer destination IP address, or both. If both inner-ip and outer-ip are specified, known unicast packets are load balanced based on the outer source IP address and inner source MAC address, outer destination IP address and inner destination MAC address, or both.
    In PPPoE scenarios, if hash calculation needs to be performed based on the source and destination IP addresses of inner IP packets of PPPoE packets, you need to configure an enhanced profile on the Eth-Trunk interface. In the enhanced profile, the l2 field must contain smac and dmac.
