bfd all-interfaces(RIP)
Function

The bfd all-interfaces command sets BFD session parameters.

The undo bfd all-interfaces command restores BFD session parameters to default values.

By default, the minimum intervals for receiving and sending BFD packets are 1000 ms and the detection time multiplier is 3.

Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

min-rx-interval min-receive-value
	

Specifies the minimum interval for receiving BFD packets from the peer.
	
The value is an integer that ranges from 100 to 1000, in milliseconds.

    After the set service-mode enhanced command is configured on the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, and S5731S-S, the value ranges from 3 to 1000.
    After the set service-mode enhanced-bfd command is configured on the S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S, the value ranges from 3 to 1000.

min-tx-interval min-transmit-value
	

Specifies the minimum interval for sending BFD packets to the peer.
	
The value is an integer that ranges from 100 to 1000, in milliseconds.

    After the set service-mode enhanced command is configured on the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, and S5731S-S, the value ranges from 3 to 1000.
    After the set service-mode enhanced-bfd command is configured on the S5732-H, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S, the value ranges from 3 to 1000.

detect-multiplier detect-multiplier-value
	

Indicates the local detection multiplier.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 3 to 50. The default value is 3.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The priority of BFD configured on an interface is higher than that configured for a RIP process. If BFD is enabled on an interface, BFD sessions are established using the BFD parameters set on the interface.

Actual interval at which BFD packets are transmitted on the local device = Max { transmit-value on the local device, receive-value on the peer}.

Actual interval at which BFD packets are received on the local device = Max { transmit-value on the peer, receive-value on the local device}.

Local BFD detection time = Actual interval at which BFD packets are received on the local device x detect-multiplier-value on the peer.

Prerequisites

BFD has been enabled on all the interfaces using the bfd all-interfaces enable command in the RIP view.
Example

# Configure BFD for a RIP process and set the minimum interval for sending BFD packets to 500 ms.
