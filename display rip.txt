filter-policy export (RIP)
Function

The filter-policy export command configures egress filtering policy for RIP routes.

The undo filter-policy export command deletes the filtering policy.

By default, no filtering policy is configured.
Format

filter-policy { acl-number | acl-name acl-name | ip-prefix ip-prefix-name } export [ protocol [ process-id ] | interface-type interface-number ]

undo filter-policy [ acl-number | acl-name acl-name | ip-prefix ip-prefix-name ] export [ protocol [ process-id ] | interface-type interface-number ]
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

acl-number
	

Specifies the number of the basic ACL that is used to filter the destination addresses of routes.
	

The value is an integer ranging from 2000 to 2999.

acl-name acl-name
	

Specifies the ACL filtering route destination addresses.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 64 case-sensitive characters without spaces. The value must start with a letter.

ip-prefix ip-prefix-name
	

Specifies the name of the IP prefix list that is used to filter the destination addresses of routes.
	

The name is a string of 1 to 169 case-sensitive characters, with spaces not supported. When double quotation marks are used around the string, spaces are allowed in the string.

protocol process-id
	

Specifies the name of the routing protocol that exports the routes and the protocol process ID.

The imported route type can be static, direct, rip, ospf, bgp, unr and isis. The process ID must be specified when routes are imported from isis, rip or ospf.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 65535.

interface-type interface-number
	

Specifies type and number of the interface based on which routes are filtered.

Usage Guidelines

Only filtered routes can be added to routing tables and advertised in Update packets.

When you remove an interface-based filtering policy, you must specify interface-type interface-number in the undo filter-policy export command. The policy on only one interface can be deleted each time.

This command runs in the RIP view. If the filtering policy is based on interfaces or protocols, each interface or protocol can be configured with only one filtering policy. If the interface or protocol is not specified, a global filtering rule is configured. Only one global filtering rule can be configured each time. If you run the command again when a global rule exists, the new policy overwrites the old one.

For an ACL, when the rule command is used to configure a filtering rule, the filtering rule is effective only with the source address range that is specified by the source parameter and with the time period that is specified by the time-range parameter.
Example

# Filter the imported static routes based on the IP prefix list named abc. Then, only the routes that match the filtering policy are added into the RIP routing table and then sent through RIP Update packets.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] rip 100
[HUAWEI-rip-100] filter-policy ip-prefix abc export static

# Filter the routes imported from IS-IS process 1 based on ACL 2002. Only the routes that match the filtering policy are added into the RIP routing table and then sent through RIP Update packets.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] rip 100
[HUAWEI-rip-100] filter-policy 2002 export isis 1
