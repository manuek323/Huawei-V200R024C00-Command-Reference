Usage Guidelines

RUs do not support web-based management and cannot have commands run on them for configuration. All RU configurations are delivered by the central switch. You can run the display remote-unit commit result command on the central switch to view configuration delivery results. To clear configuration delivery records, you can run the reset remote-unit commit result command.

After this command is run, configuration delivery records of RUs are cleared and cannot be restored.
Example

# Clear configuration delivery records of RUs.

<HUAWEI> reset remote-unit commit result
