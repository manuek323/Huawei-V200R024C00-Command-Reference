The display said-node brief command displays brief information about SAID nodes.
Format

display said-node { all | said-name } brief [ slot slot-id ]
Parameters

Parameter
	

Description
	

Value

all
	

Indicates all SAID nodes.
	

-

said-name
	

Specifies an SAID node.
	

The value depends on the device configuration.

Item
	

Description

Node ID
	

ID of an SAID node.

Node Name
	

Name of the SAID node.

Type
	
Type of the SAID node:

    Detect: diagnostic node
    Restore: self-healing node

Cycle(s)
	

Detection period of the SAID node, in seconds.

Enable Status
	
Whether the SAID node is enabled:

    Enable: The SAID node is enabled.
    Disable: The SAID node is disabled.

Active Status
	
Running status of the SAID node:

    Active: The SAID node is running.
    Inactive: The SAID node is not running.

Inactive Reason
	
Whether the SAID node is activated:

    -: The SAID node is enabled and activated.
    Node disabled: The SAID node is not activated.

set said-node disable
Function

The set said-node disable command disables SAID nodes.

The undo set said-node disable command enables SAID nodes.

By default, all SAID nodes are enabled.
Format

set said-node { all | said-name &<1-6> } disable

undo set said-node { all | said-name &<1-6> } disable
Parameters

Parameter
	

Description
	

Value

all
	

Indicates all SAID nodes.
	

-

said-name
	

Specifies an SAID node.
	

The value depends on the device configuration.

A maximum of six SAID nodes can be configured at a time. If you need to configure more than six SAID nodes, run the set said-node disable command multiple times.

Usage Scenario

The System of Active Immunization and Diagnosis (SAID) is an intelligent fault diagnosis system that automatically diagnoses and rectifies some faults by simulating human operations in troubleshooting. The SAID system has multiple SAID nodes, which detect, diagnose, and rectify faults of multiple modules. However, if a node processes a large number of services, the processing efficiency of other nodes is affected. In this case, run this command disable this node.
Currently, the switch supports the following SAID nodes listed in Table 3-169.

Node Name
	

Node Type

FLASH-WRITE
	

Diagnostic node

MAC
	

Self-healing node

STG
	

Self-healing node

PORT
	

Self-healing node

VLAN

SE-REG
NOTE:

Only the S2730S-S, S5735-L-I, S5735-L1,S300, S5735-L, S5735S-L1, S5735-S, S500, S5735-S-I, support this node.
	

Self-healing node

SE-TABLE
NOTE:

Only the S2730S-S, S5735-L-I, S5735-L1,S300, S5735-L, S5735S-L1, S5735-S, S500, S5735-S-I, support this node.
	

Self-healing node

CONFD-MEMORY
	

Self-healing node

PING
	

Diagnostic node

After this node is enabled, the device periodically sends ICMP ping packets.

Precautions

If some cards do not support a specific SAID node and no cards that support this SAID node are installed on the device, the device displays a message, indicating that the device does not support this SAID node.
Example

# Disable the SAID nodes mac and stg.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] set said-node mac stg disable

# Disable all SAID nodes.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] set said-node all disable
