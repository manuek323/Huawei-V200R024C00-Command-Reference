Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

After an RU is delivered, its downlink interfaces are in the same broadcast domain and are not isolated by default. This allows users connected to the same RU to communicate with each other before being authenticated. To prevent this, you can configure port isolation on RUs. To isolate downlink interface on a single RU, run the isolate enable command in the view of the RU.

Precautions

The port isolation configuration specific to an RU has a higher priority than the global port isolation configuration.

Follow-up Procedure

After running this command, run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.
Example

# Disable port isolation on an RU.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
[HUAWEI-remote-unit-0] isolate disable
