Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To deliver configurations to an RU, you need to bind an interface on the central switch to the RU for interconnection. After interface binding, you can run the remote-unit connect-interface interface-type interface-number command on the central switch to enter the view of an RU by specifying an interconnection interface, and run the display remote-unit connect-interface interface-type interface-number command to view information about an RU bound to a specific interconnection interface.

Precautions

    An interface can be bound to only one RU.
    An Eth-Trunk physical member interface cannot be bound to an RU.

Example

# Bind XGigabitEthernet0/0/1 to the RU 0.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
[HUAWEI-remote-unit-0] bind interface XGigabitEthernet 0/0/1
