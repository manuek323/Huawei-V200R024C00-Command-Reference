Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When RUs are deployed in places such as hotels and dormitories, the blinking of indicators on the RUs may affect users' rest at night. You can run the led off command to turn off indicators on RUs to reduce the impact on users, for example, to turn off the indicators from 8:00 p.m. every day to 7:00 a.m. the next day.

Follow-up Procedure

After you run this command to turn on or off indicators on RUs, you need to run the commit command to deliver the configuration to make the configuration take effect.

Precautions

If this command is configured in both the remote-unit view and remote-unit N view, the configuration in the remote-unit N view takes effect.
