Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

After configuring an RU by running commands on the central switch, such as configuring the port rate, port isolation, port shutdown, or port negotiation, you need to run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.

Precautions

A central switch does not deliver configurations to RUs that fail to be authenticated or are not authenticated.

RUs do not save their configurations. After the central switch or an RU is restarted and works normally, the central switch preferentially delivers the configuration in the single RU view. If no configuration is available in the single RU view, the central switch delivers the configuration in the global RU view.
Example

# Deliver configurations to RU 0.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
[HUAWEI-remote-unit-0] commit
