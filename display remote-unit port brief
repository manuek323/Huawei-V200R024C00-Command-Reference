Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To monitor interfaces on an RU or locate faults on interfaces, you can run the display remote-unit port brief command to view information about the interfaces, including the physical status, auto-negotiation status, working mode, and rate. If no parameter is specified, brief information about interfaces on all RUs is displayed.

Precautions

    An uplink 2.5GE optical interface of an RU does not support a copper module, and supports only a GE or 2.5GE optical module. In V200R022C10 and earlier versions, the uplink interface configured with a GE optical module can connect to a central switch only when it works at the rate of 1 Gbit/s. In V200R023C00 and later versions, the uplink interface configured with a 2.5GE optical module can connect to a central switch when it works at the rate of 2.5 Gbit/s. After the rate of the uplink interface is changed, the RU automatically restarts for the change to take effect.
    An uplink 2.5GE hybrid optical-electrical interface of an RU does not support a copper module, and supports only a GE or 2.5GE optical or hybrid module. In V200R022C10 and earlier versions, the uplink interface configured with a GE optical or hybrid module can connect to a central switch only when it works at the rate of 1 Gbit/s. In V200R023C00 and later versions, the uplink interface configured with a 2.5GE optical or hybrid module can connect to a central switch when it works at the rate of 2.5 Gbit/s. After the rate of the uplink interface is changed, the RU automatically restarts for the change to take effect.
