Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

An RU can connect to different types of terminals using its downlink interfaces and distinguish terminal services by joining its downlink interfaces to different VLANs. By default, all interfaces on an RU work in transparent VLAN mode. That is, the RU does not change the VLAN IDs of received packets. If services of downlink terminals connected to an RU need to be divided based on VLANs, you need to run the vlan mode manual command to configure the RU to work in manual VLAN mode, and then configure default and allowed VLANs for interfaces on the RU.

An RU saves the VLAN configuration delivered by the central switch to it in its flash memory and forwards traffic based on this VLAN configuration after being powered on. After the RU goes online on the central switch, the central switch synchronizes the latest VLAN configuration to the RU's flash memory.

Follow-up Procedure

    Configure default and allowed VLANs for interfaces on the RU.
    After you run the commands for configuring the VLAN mode for an RU and VLANs for RU interfaces, run the commit command to deliver the VLAN configuration to the RU or bring the RU offline and then online again for the configuration to take effect.

Precautions

You can configure the VLAN mode of an RU in the remote-unit view or remote-unit N view. If the VLAN mode is configured in both views, the configuration in the remote-unit N view takes effect. If no VLAN mode is configured in the remote-unit N view, the configuration in the remote-unit view takes effect.
