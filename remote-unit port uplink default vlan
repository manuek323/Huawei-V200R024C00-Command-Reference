remote-unit port uplink default vlan
Function

The remote-unit port uplink default vlan command configures the default VLAN for uplink interfaces on RUs in batches.

The undo remote-unit port uplink default vlan command restores the default setting.

By default, an uplink interface on an RU uses VLAN 1 as its default VLAN.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If terminals connected to multiple RUs carry the same service and use the same service VLAN, you can run the remote-unit port uplink default vlan command to configure the service VLAN as the default VLAN for the uplink interfaces on the RUs in batches.

An RU saves the VLAN configuration delivered by the central switch to it in its flash memory and forwards traffic based on this VLAN configuration after being powered on. After the RU goes online on the central switch, the central switch synchronizes the latest VLAN configuration to the RU's flash memory.

Prerequisites

You have run the vlan mode manual command to configure the manual VLAN mode for the RU.

Follow-up procedure

After you run the commands for configuring the VLAN mode for an RU and VLANs for RU interfaces, run the commit command to deliver the VLAN configuration to the RU or bring the RU offline and then online again for the configuration to take effect.
Example

# Set VLAN 10 as the default VLAN for the uplink interfaces on RUs 0 to 4.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit
[HUAWEI-remote-unit] remote-unit 0 to 4 port uplink default vlan 10
