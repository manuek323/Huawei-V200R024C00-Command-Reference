Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If an RU fails to be upgraded, it enters the cooldown period and can be upgraded again only after the cooldown period ends. To upgrade the firmware of RUs in the cooldown period, you can run this command to configure forcible upgrade.

Precautions

During the BIOS firmware upgrade of RUs, do not power off or disconnect the RUs. Otherwise, the RUs cannot be started.

The upgrade force command upgrades firmware of an RU, regardless of whether the RU has the upgrade function enabled. After this command is run in the view of a single RU, the RU immediately restarts with firmware of the new version.
Example

# Configure forcible APP firmware upgrade for RUs.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] remote-unit 0
[HUAWEI-remote-unit-0] upgrade app force
