5.22 Configuring OSPF Neighbor Relationship Flapping
Suppression
Applicable Environment
If an interface carrying OSPF services frequently alternates between Up and Down,
the OSPF neighbor relationship flaps on the interface. In this case, OSPF frequently
sends Hello packets to reestablish the neighbor relationship, synchronizes LSDBs,
and recalculates routes. In this process, a large number of packets are exchanged,

adversely affecting stability of existing neighbor relationships, OSPF services, and
other OSPF-dependent services, such as LDP and BGP. To address this problem,
OSPF implements suppression of neighbor relationship flapping to delay OSPF
neighbor relationship reestablishment or prevent service traffic from passing
through flapping links.
NOTE
The following steps are optional.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring OSPF neighbor relationship flapping suppression, complete the
following tasks:
● Configure IP addresses for interfaces to ensure that neighboring nodes are
reachable at the network layer.
● 5.8 Configuring Basic OSPF Functions
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
By default, suppression of OSPF neighbor relationship flapping is enabled globally.
To disable this function globally, run the suppress-flapping peer disable
command.
Step 2 Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
By default, suppression of OSPF neighbor relationship flapping is enabled on all
interfaces in the same OSPF process. To disable this function on an interface, run
the ospf suppress-flapping peer disable command.
Step 3 Run ospf suppress-flapping peer hold-down
interval
The Hold-down mode of flapping suppression is configured, and the suppression
duration is set.
Flapping suppression works in either Hold-down or Hold-max-cost mode.
● Hold-down mode: In the case of frequent flooding and topology changes
during neighbor relationship establishment in an interface, the interface
prevents the reestablishment of the neighbor relationship, which minimizes
LSDB synchronization attempts and packet exchanges.
● Hold-max-cost mode: If the traffic forwarding path changes frequently, the
interface uses the maximum value 65535 as the cost of the flapping link,
which prevents traffic from passing through the flapping link.
Flapping suppression can also work first in Hold-down mode and then in Hold-
max-cost mode after the Hold-down mode exits.
By default, only the Hold-max-cost mode is enabled.
To disable the Hold-max-cost mode, run the ospf suppress-flapping peer hold-
max-cost disable command.

Step 4 Run ospf suppress-flapping peer { detecting-interval
detecting-interval |
threshold
threshold | resume-interval
resume-interval } *
Detection parameters are configured for OSPF neighbor relationship flapping
suppression.
Each OSPF interface with OSPF neighbor relationship flapping suppression
enabled starts a flapping counter. If the interval between two successive status
changes of a neighbor from Full to a non-Full state is shorter than
detecting-
interval, a valid flapping_event is recorded and the flapping_count increments by
1. When the flapping_count reaches or exceeds
threshold, flapping suppression
takes effect. If the interval between two successive status changes of a neighbor
from Full to a non-Full state is longer than
resume-interval, the flapping_count is
reset.
NOTE
The value of
resume-interval must be greater than that of
detecting-interval.
By default, the value of detecting-interval is 60s, the value threshold is 10, and
the value of resume-interval is 120s. Default values of the detection parameters
are recommended.
Step 5 Run quit
The system view is displayed.
Step 6 Run quit
The user view is displayed.
Step 7 Run reset ospf
process-id suppress-flapping peer [
interface-type interface-
number ] [ notify-peer ]
The interface is forced to exit the suppression of OSPF neighbor relationship
flapping.
NOTE
An interface exits flapping suppression in any of the following scenarios:
● The suppression timer expires.
● The corresponding OSPF process is reset.
● Suppression of OSPF neighbor relationship flapping is disabled globally using the
suppress-flapping peer disable command in the OSPF view.
● The reset ospf suppress-flapping peer command is run.

The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure VLANs for interfaces, VLANIF interfaces for the VLANs, and IP
addresses for each VLANIF interface to implement communication within
network segments.
2. Configure basic OSPF functions on each switch. Configure SwitchA as the ABR

5.26.2 Example for Configuring OSPF DR Election
Networking Requirements
As shown in Figure 5-70, five switches are deployed with the intermediate Layer 2
switch connecting the other four switches running OSPF. The DR elected by default
among the four switches does not meet the network requirements. SwitchA needs
to be elected as the DR to exchange LSA information with other devices on the
OSPF network, and SwitchC needs to be used as the backup of SwitchA. For other
service demands, SwitchB needs to exchange LSA information with other devices
on the OSPF network through the DR.

The preceding command output shows that the DR election result among the four
switches remains unchanged. This is because that, even if a newly added device
has the highest DR priority, the device cannot immediately become the DR on the
network segment after the DR and BDR election is complete. DR and BDR election
is performed again only after the OSPF process is restarted.
Step 5 Restart the OSPF process.
# In the user view of each switch, run the reset ospf 1 process command to
restart the OSPF process simultaneously. The simultaneous restart of the OSPF
process enables each switch to participate in elections of the DR and BDR.

5.26.3 Example for Configuring OSPF Stub Areas
Networking Requirements
As shown in Figure 5-71, OSPF is running among three switches, the entire OSPF
network is partitioned into Area0 and Area1, and SwitchB functions as an ASBR to
communicate with external networks. The size of the OSPF routing table on
SwitchC needs to be reduced, which is expected not to affect the communication.
Figure 5-71 Networking diagram for configuring an OSPF stub area
Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure basic OSPF functions on each switch to implement basic
connections on the OSPF network.
2. Configure static routes on SwitchB and import them to the OSPF routing table
so that there are reachable routes between the OSPF network and external
networks.
3. Configure Area1 as a stub area to reduce the size of the OSPF routing table
on SwitchC.
4. Disable the ABR (SwitchA) from advertising Type 3 LSAs to Area1 (this
configuration indicates that Area 1 is configured as a totally stub area) to
further reduce the size of the OSPF routing table on SwitchC.

5.26.4 Example for Configuring an OSPF NSSA
Networking Requirements
As shown in Figure 5-72, OSPF is running on four switches, and the entire OSPF
network is partitioned into Area0 and Area1. It is required that devices in Area1 do
not receive external routes imported by other OSPF areas but they import external
routes through the ASBR to communicate with external networks. Because there
are a large number of services configured on SwitchB, SwitchA needs to be
specified as a translator to translate Type7 LSAs to Type5 LSAs and send them to
other OSPF areas.
NOTE
In this scenario, ensure that all connected interfaces have STP disabled. If STP is enabled
and VLANIF interfaces of switches are used to construct a Layer 3 ring network, an
interface on the network will be blocked. As a result, Layer 3 services on the network
cannot run normally.
Figure 5-72 Networking diagram for configuring an OSPF NSSA
Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure basic OSPF functions on each switch to implement basic
connections on the OSPF network.

2. Configure Area1 as an NSSA, configure static routes on SwitchD, and import
the static routes to the OSPF routing table. In this way, switches in Area1 can
communicate with external networks only through SwitchD.
3. Configure SwitchA as a translator so that it can translate Type7 LSAs to Type5
LSAs and then send them to other OSPF areas.

5.26.5 Example for Configuring OSPF Load Balancing
Networking Requirements
On an OSPF network, as shown in Figure 5-73, four switches all belong to Area0.
Load balancing needs to be configured so that the traffic from SwitchA can be
sent to SwitchD through SwitchB and SwitchC.
NOTE
In this scenario, ensure that all connected interfaces have STP disabled. If STP is enabled
and VLANIF interfaces of switches are used to construct a Layer 3 ring network, an
interface on the network will be blocked. As a result, Layer 3 services on the network
cannot run normally.

Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure basic OSPF functions on each switch to implement basic
connections on the OSPF network.
2. Configure load balancing on SwitchA.
Procedure
Step 1 Configure VLANs for interfaces.
# Configure SwitchA. The configurations of SwitchB, SwitchC, and SwitchD are
similar to the configuration of SwitchA.

The preceding command output shows that both next hops of SwitchA, namely,
10.1.1.2 (SwitchB) and 10.1.2.2 (SwitchC), become valid. This is because that the
default quantity of equal-cost routes allowed for a switch is 8.
Step 4 Configure a weight for an equal-cost route on SwitchA.
If you do not want load balancing between SwitchB and SwitchC, set a weight for
one of the equal-cost routes to specify the next hop.

192.168.1.0/24 OSPF 10 2 D 10.1.2.2 Vlanif20
The preceding command output shows that the priority of the next hop 10.1.2.2
(SwitchC) with weight 1 is higher than that of 10.1.1.2 (SwitchB). Therefore, OSPF
selects the route with the next hop 10.1.2.2 as the optimal route.

5.26.6 Example for Configuring OSPF-BGP Synchronization
Networking Requirements
As shown in Figure 5-74, an EBGP connection is established between SwitchD and
SwitchE. IBGP connections are established between switches in AS 10, and OSPF is
used as an IGP protocol. OSPF-BGP synchronization needs to be enabled on
SwitchB so that the traffic from SwitchA to AS 20 will not be interrupted when
SwitchB restarts.
NOTE
In this scenario, ensure that all connected interfaces have STP disabled. If STP is enabled
and VLANIF interfaces of switches are used to construct a Layer 3 ring network, an
interface on the network will be blocked. As a result, Layer 3 services on the network
cannot run normally.
Figure 5-74 Networking diagram for configuring OSPF-BGP synchronization
Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure VLANs for interfaces, VLANIF interfaces for the VLANs, and IP
addresses for each VLANIF interface to implement communication within
network segments.

2. Configure basic OSPF functions and IBGP connections on SwitchA, SwitchB,
SwitchC, and SwitchD (excluding 10.2.1.1/30) to implement device
connections within AS 10.
3. Configure EBGP connections between SwitchD and SwitchE, and import direct
routes and OSPF routes to implement communication between AS 10 and AS
20.
4. Set the OSPF protocol cost to 2 on SwitchC so that SwitchA selects only
SwitchB as the intermediate router to the network segment 10.2.1.0 and
SwitchC becomes the backup of SwitchB.
5. Enable OSPF-BGP synchronization on SwitchB so that the traffic from SwitchA
to AS 20 will not be interrupted when SwitchB restarts.
Procedure
Step 1 Configure VLANs for interfaces.

5.26.7 Example for Configuring OSPF GR
Networking Requirements
As shown in Figure 5-75, OSPF is running among three switches, and the entire
OSPF network is partitioned into Area0 and Area1. It is required that restarting the
OSPF process on SwitchC does not affect data forwarding.

Figure 5-75 Networking diagram for configuring OSPF GR
Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure basic OSPF functions on each switch to implement basic
connections on the OSPF network.
2. Enable the Opaque LSA function on SwitchA and SwitchC so that OSPF
supports OSPF GR through Type9 LSA.
3. Configure the GR function on SwitchA and SwitchC so that data is forwarded
properly when OSPF restarts.
Procedure
Step 1 Configure VLANs for interfaces.
# Configure SwitchA. The configurations of SwitchB and SwitchC are similar to the
configuration of SwitchA.
<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] sysname SwitchA
[SwitchA] vlan batch 10 20
[SwitchA] interface gigabitethernet 0/0/1
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] port link-type trunk
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] port trunk allow-pass vlan 10
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] quit
[SwitchA] interface gigabitethernet 0/0/2
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/2] port link-type trunk
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/2] port trunk allow-pass vlan 20
[SwitchA-GigabitEthernet0/0/2] quit
Step 2 Configure an IP address for each VLANIF interface.
# Configure SwitchA. The configurations of SwitchB and SwitchC are similar to the
configuration of SwitchA.
[SwitchA] interface vlanif 10
[SwitchA-Vlanif10] ip address 192.168.0.1 24
[SwitchA-Vlanif10] quit
[SwitchA] interface vlanif 20
[SwitchA-Vlanif20] ip address 192.168.1.1 24
[SwitchA-Vlanif20] quit
Step 3 Configure basic OSPF functions.
# Configure SwitchA.
[SwitchA] ospf 1 router-id 10.1.1.1

[SwitchC-ospf-1-area-0.0.0.1] quit
[SwitchC-ospf-1] quit
Step 4 Enable the Opaque LSA function.
# Configure SwitchA.
[SwitchA] ospf 1
[SwitchA-ospf-1] opaque-capability enable
[SwitchA-ospf-1] quit
# Configure SwitchC.
[SwitchC] ospf 1
[SwitchC-ospf-1] opaque-capability enable
[SwitchC-ospf-1] quit
Step 5 Configure the OSPF GR feature.
# Configure SwitchA.
[SwitchA] ospf 1
[SwitchA-ospf-1] graceful-restart
[SwitchA-ospf-1] return
# Configure SwitchC.
[SwitchC] ospf 1
[SwitchC-ospf-1] graceful-restart
[SwitchC-ospf-1] return
Step 6 Verify the configuration.
# Check the GR status of SwitchC.

5.26.8 Example for Configuring BFD for OSPF
Networking Requirements
As shown in Figure 5-76, OSPF is running among SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC,
and the switch between SwitchA and SwitchB only provides transparent
transmission. It is required that SwitchA and SwitchB quickly detect the status of
the link between them and services be quickly switched to the backup link
SwitchA-SwitchC-SwitchB when the link SwitchA-SwitchB becomes faulty.
NOTE
In this scenario, ensure that all connected interfaces have STP disabled. If STP is enabled
and VLANIF interfaces of switches are used to construct a Layer 3 ring network, an
interface on the network will be blocked. As a result, Layer 3 services on the network
cannot run normally.
Figure 5-76 Networking diagram for configuring BFD for OSPF
Configuration Roadmap
The configuration roadmap is as follows:
1. Configure basic OSPF functions on each switch to implement basic
connections on the OSPF network.
2. Configure BFD for OSPF on each switch so that services are quickly switched
to the backup link if the link between SwitchA and SwitchB is faulty.

5.26.9 Example for Configuring OSPF IP FRR
Networking Requirements
As shown in Figure 5-77, four switches belong to the same OSPF area. It is
required that traffic forwarded by SwitchA be protected. The specific requirements
are as follows:
● In normal scenarios, traffic of SwitchA is forwarded over the primary link
SwitchA-SwitchC.
● When the primary link SwitchA-SwitchC fails, traffic is fast switched to the
backup link SwitchA-SwitchB without waiting for route convergence, ensuring
uninterrupted traffic forwarding.
NOTE
In this scenario, ensure that all connected interfaces have STP disabled. If STP is enabled
and VLANIF interfaces of switches are used to construct a Layer 3 ring network, an
interface on the network will be blocked. As a result, Layer 3 services on the network
cannot run normally.

5.26.10 Example for Configuring Local OSPF MT
Networking Requirements
As shown in Figure 5-78, multicast and an IGP Shortcut-enabled MPLS TE tunnel
are configured on a network. The outbound interface of the route calculated by
IGP may be a TE tunnel interface, not a physical interface. The TE tunnel interface
on the switch sends multicast Join packets over a unicast route to the multicast
source address. The multicast Join packets are transparent to SwitchC through
which the TE tunnel passes. As a result, SwitchC cannot generate multicast
forwarding entries. To resolve the problem, you can enable local OSPF MT on
SwitchB. With local MT enabled, if the outbound interface of a route after
calculation is an IGP Shortcut-enabled TE tunnel interface, the routing
management (RM) module creates an independent Multicast IGP (MIGP) routing
table, calculates the physical outbound interface for the route, and adds the route
to the MIGP routing table. Multicast packets are then forwarded along the routes
in the MIGP routing table.

1. Configure basic OSPF functions on each switch to implement basic
connections on the OSPF network.
2. Configure multicast PIM-SM on each switch so that the host can receive the
multicast data from the source.
3. Configure the MPLS RSVP-TE tunnel function on SwitchB, SwitchC, and
SwitchD, configure an MPLS TE tunnel interface on SwitchB, and establish a
TE tunnel from SwitchB to SwitchD.
4. Configure the IGP-Shortcut function on SwitchB so that SwitchB uses the TE
tunnel interface as the outbound interface.
5. Configure the local OSPF MT function on SwitchB so that a physical outbound
interface is created in the MIGP routing table as the next-hop of each route
whose original outbound interface is a TE tunnel interface.

5.27 Troubleshooting OSPF
5.27.1 An OSPF Neighbor Relationship Cannot Be Established
Fault Symptom
An OSPF neighbor relationship cannot be established between two devices.
Procedure
Step 1 Check whether the physical status and protocol status of interfaces on both ends
of the link are Up and stable, whether packets are lost on the interfaces, and
whether the two devices can ping each other using packets longer than 1500
bytes.
If the physical status of the interfaces is not Up or unstable (interfaces flap for
example), check whether the link connection is normal and whether the protocol
status of the interfaces is Up. Ensure that no error packet statistics exist on the
interfaces.
If packet loss occurs during the ping test, check whether the MTUs of device
interfaces along which ping packets travel are properly set.
Step 2 Check whether the two devices have the same OSPF process router ID.
Run the display ospf [
process-id ] brief command on the two devices
respectively to check the OSPF process router IDs of them.
Each router ID in an OSPF process must be unique on the entire network.
Otherwise, devices on both ends of the link cannot establish an OSPF neighbor
relationship, and routing information will be incorrect.
If the two devices have the same OSPF process router ID, run the ospf [
process-
id ] router-id
router-id command in the system view to change the OSPF process
router IDs and ensure that the two devices have different OSPF process router IDs.
After changing an OSPF process router ID, run the reset ospf [
process-id ]
process command in the user view to make the new router ID take effect.
Step 3 Check whether the two devices have the same OSPF area ID.
Run the display ospf [
process-id ] brief command on the two devices
respectively to check the OSPF area IDs of them.
If the two devices have different OSPF area IDs, run the area
area-id command in
the OSPF view to change the OSPF area IDs and ensure that the two devices have
the same OSPF area ID.
Step 4 Check whether OSPF interfaces on both ends of the link have the same network
type.
Run the display ospf [
process-id ] interface command on the two devices
respectively to check the OSPF interface network types of them.

The OSPF interfaces on both ends of a link must have the same network type;
otherwise, the two interfaces cannot establish an OSPF neighbor relationship.
If the network types of the two OSPF interfaces are different, run the ospf
network-type { broadcast | nbma | p2mp | p2p } command in the OSPF interface
view to change the OSPF interface network types and ensure the network type
consistency between the two interfaces.
NOTE
If the network types of OSPF interfaces on both ends of the link are NBMA, run the peer
ip-address [ dr-priority
priority ] command in the OSPF view to configure NBMA neighbors.
Step 5 Check whether OSPF interfaces on both ends of the link have the same IP address
mask.
Run the display current-configuration interface
interface-type interface-number
command on the two devices respectively to check the IP addresses of the
specified OSPF interfaces on the devices.
The OSPF interfaces on both ends of a link must have the same IP address mask;
otherwise, the two interfaces cannot establish an OSPF neighbor relationship. On
a P2MP network, to disable devices from checking the network masks so that an
OSPF neighbor relationship can be established, run the ospf p2mp-mask-ignore
command in the OSPF interface view.
If the two OSPF interfaces have different IP address masks, run the ip address
ip-
address {
mask |
mask-length } command in the OSPF interface view to change
the IP address masks and ensure the IP address mask consistency between the
two interfaces.
Step 6 Check whether IP addresses of OSPF interfaces on both ends of the link reside in
the network segment specified in the network command.
Run the display current-configuration interface
interface-type interface-number
command on the two devices respectively to check IP addresses of the OSPF
interfaces on both ends of the link, and run the display current-configuration
configuration ospf command on the two devices respectively to check the OSPF
process configuration.
OSPF can run on an interface only when the following conditions are met:
● The mask length of the interface's IP address is longer than or equal to that
converted from the wildcard mask specified by the network command. OSPF
uses wildcard masks. For example, 0.0.0.255 indicates that the mask length is
24 bits.
● The primary IP address of the interface resides in the network segment
specified in the network command.
If the IP address of an interface does not meet the preceding conditions, run the ip
address
ip-address {
mask |
mask-length } command in the OSPF-enabled
interface view to change the IP address of the interface. Alternatively, in the view
of the area to which the OSPF process belongs, run the network command to
change the configured network segment so that the IP address of the interface
can meet the preceding conditions.
Step 7 Check whether the DR priorities of OSPF interfaces on both ends of the link are 0.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 5 OSPF Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 380
Run the display ospf [
process-id ] interface command on the two devices
respectively to check the DR priorities of the OSPF interfaces.
On a broadcast or NBMA network, at least one OSPF interface needs to have a DR
priority higher than 0 so that the DR can be elected. Otherwise, the neighbor
status of devices on both ends of the link only can reach 2-Way.
If the DR priorities of the two OSPF interfaces are both 0, run the ospf dr-priority
priority command in the OSPF interface view to change the DR priorities. Ensure
that there is at least one OSPF interface has a DR priority higher than 0.

5.27.2 OSPF Cannot Discover Routes of a Non-Local Area
Symptom
There are no problems with a link, but OSPF cannot discover routes of a non-local
area.
Procedure
Step 1 Check whether the area where the device resides is connected to the backbone
area.
Run the display ospf [
process-id ] brief command on the ABR in the area where
the device resides to check the area configuration.
OSPF requires that all non-backbone areas be connected to the backbone area.
If no backbone area information is configured on the ABR, run the area
area-id
command in the OSPF view to modify the OSPF area information. Ensure that at
least one interface on the ABR runs in the backbone area.
NOTE
If non-backbone areas cannot be connected to the backbone area due to networking
restrictions, you can configure OSPF virtual links to resolve this problem.
Step 2 Check whether the area where the device resides is a totally stub area.
Run the display current-configuration configuration ospf [
process-id ]
command on the device to check the OSPF process configuration.
If you specify the parameter no-summary when configuring a non-backbone area
as a stub area on the ABR (that is, running the stub no-summary command in
the OSPF area view), the area is configured as a totally stub area.
A totally stub area allows only intra-area routes to be advertised within the area.
If the area where the device resides is configured as a totally stub area, perform
the following configurations based on service requirements:
● To restore the totally stub area to a common area, run the undo stub
command in the OSPF area view on all devices in the area.
● To restore a totally stub area to a stub area, run the undo stub command in
the OSPF area view on the ABR in the area and then run the stub command.

Step 3 Check whether the area where the device resides is a totally NSSA.
Run the display current-configuration configuration ospf [
process-id ]
command on the device to check the OSPF process configuration.
If you specify the parameter no-summary when configuring a non-backbone area
as an NSSA on the ABR (that is, running the nssa no-summary command in the
OSPF area view), the area is configured as a totally NSSA.
A totally NSSA allows only intra-area routes to be advertised within the area.
If the area where the device resides is configured as a totally NSSA, perform the
following configuration based on service requirements:
● To restore the totally NSSA to a common area, run the undo nssa command
in the OSPF area view on all devices in the area.
● To restore a totally NSSA to a stub area, run the undo nssa command in the
OSPF area view on the ABR in the area and then run the nssa command.

6.1 Overview of OSPFv3
Definition
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
OSPF Version 3 (OSPFv3), as defined in RFC 2740 and expanded in RFC 5340, is a
modification of OSPFv2 allowing IPv6 support.
Purpose
The primary purpose of OSPFv3 is to develop a routing protocol independent of
any specific network layer. The internal routing information of OSPFv3 has been
redesigned to serve this purpose.
OSPFv3 and OSPFv2 differ as follows:
● OSPFv3 is used in IPv6, while OSPFv2 is used in IPv4.
OSPFv3 does not insert IP-based data in the header of an IP packet or Link
State Advertisement (LSA).
● OSPFv3 uses protocol-independent information to execute crucial tasks that
originally required the use of the data in the IP packet header, for example, to
identify LSAs that advertise routing data.
6.2 Understanding OSPFv3
6.2.1 OSPFv3 Fundamentals
● The working principles of Hello messages, state machines, link-state
databases (LSDBs), flooding, and route calculation are the same in OSPFv3
and OSPFv2.
● OSPFv3 divides an Autonomous System (AS) into one or more logical areas
and advertises routes through LSAs.
● OSPFv3 ensures routing information consistency by exchanging OSPFv3
packets between routers within an OSPFv3 area.
● OSPFv3 packets are encapsulated into IPv6 packets, which can be transmitted
in unicast or multicast mode.
OSPFv3 Packets

Packet Type Description
Database Description (DD) Contains the summary of the local LSDB. It is
exchanged between two OSPFv3 routers to
update the LSDBs.
Link State Request (LSR) Sent to neighbors to request the required LSAs.
An OSPFv3 router sends LSR packets to its
neighbor only after they exchange DD packets.
Link State Update (LSU) Used to transmit required LSAs to neighbors.

OSPFv3 interface belongs and advertised in that
area.
● Describes the status and costs of links of the
router.
Network-LSA (Type 2) ● Generated by a designated router (DR) and
broadcast in the area to which the DR belongs.
● Describes the link status.
Inter-Area-Prefix-LSA
(Type 3)
● Generated by an area border router (ABR).
● Describes the route of a network segment within
the local area and is used to inform other areas
of the route.
Inter-Area-Router-LSA
(Type 4)
● Generated by an ABR and advertised to all
related areas, except the area to which the
autonomous system boundary router (ASBR)
belongs.
● Describes the route to the ASBR.
AS-external-LSA (Type 5) ● Generated by an ASBR and advertised to all
areas except the stub area and the not-so-stubby
area (NSSA).
● Describes routes to a destination outside the AS.
NSSA-LSA (Type 7) ● Generated by an ASBR and advertised only in
NSSAs.
● Describes routes to a destination outside the AS.

Router Type Description
Area border router (ABR) Belongs to two or more areas, one of which must
be a backbone area.
Used to connect backbone and non-backbone areas.
It can be physically or logically connected to the
backbone area.
Backbone router At least one interface on a backbone router must
belong to the backbone area.
All ABRs and internal routers in Area 0 are
backbone routers.
AS boundary router
(ASBR)
Exchanges routing information with other ASs.
May not locate on the boundary of an AS. It can be
an internal router or an ABR.
OSPFv3 Route Types
AS inter-area and intra-area routes describe routes within an AS. External routes
describe routes to destinations outside an AS. OSPFv3 classifies imported AS
external routes into Type 1 routes and Type 2 routes.
Table 6-2 lists route types in descending order of priority.
Table 6-2 Route types
Route Type Description
Intra-area route Routes that are generated from within an area (the
destination belongs to the area).
Inter-area route Routes that originate from other areas.

Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 387
Route Type Description
External route Routes that are imported into OSPF from other
routing protocols or different OSPF processes.
External routes fall into two categories: Type 1 and
Type 2 external routes. The difference between the
two types is the way the cost of a route is
calculated.
● Type 1 external route: The cost of a Type 1
external route is the addition of the external cost
(from the local device to an ASBR) and the
internal cost (from the ASBR to the destination)
used to reach that route.
● Type 2 external route: The cost of a Type 2
external route is always the external cost (from
an ASBR to the destination), irrespective of the
internal cost to reach that route.
A Type 1 external route is always preferred over a
Type 2 external route for the same destination.
Area Types
Table 6-3 Area types
Area Type Description
Totally stub area Allows Type 3 default routes advertised by the ABR, but
disallows routes outside the AS and inter-area routes.
Stub area Different from a totally stub area, a stub area allows inter-
area routes.
NSSA Different from a stub area, an NSSA allows routes outside
an AS.
An ASBR advertises Type 7 LSAs in the local area. These
Type 7 LSAs are translated into Type 5 LSAs on an ABR,
and are then flooded in the entire OSPFv3 AS.
Network Types Supported by OSPFv3
OSPFv3 classifies networks into different types according to link layer protocols.
The following table describes these network types.

Table 6-4 Network types
Network Type Description
Broadcast Default network type if the link layer protocol is
Ethernet or Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).
● Hello messages, LSU packets, and LSAck packets are
transmitted in multicast mode (FF02::5 is the reserved
IPv6 multicast address of the OSPFv3 router; FF02::6
is the reserved IPv6 multicast address of the OSPFv3
DR or BDR).
● DD packets and LSR packets are transmitted in
unicast mode.
Non-broadcast
multiple access
(NBMA)
Default network type if the link layer protocol is frame
relay, ATM, or X.25.
Protocol packets, such as Hello messages and DD, LSR,
LSU, and LSAck packets, are transmitted in unicast
mode.
Point-to-multipoint
(P2MP)
Not a default network type for any link layer protocol. A
P2MP network must be forcibly changed from other
network types. It is a common practice to change an
NBMA that is not fully connected to a P2MP network.
● Hello messages are transmitted in multicast mode to
the multicast address FF02::5.
● Other protocol packets, including DD, LSR, LSU, and
LSAck packets, are transmitted in unicast mode.
Point-to-point (P2P) Default network type if the link layer protocol is PPP,
HDLC, or LAPB.
Protocol packets, including Hello messages, DD, LSR,
LSU, and LSAck packets, are transmitted to the multicast
address FF02::5.
Stub Area
In stub areas, ABRs do not flood the received external routes. This reduces both
the size of routers' routing tables and the amount of routing information in
transmission.
Configuring a stub area is optional. Not all areas can be configured as stub areas.
Typically, a non-backbone area located at the AS boundary with only one ABR is
set to be a stub area.
To ensure the reachability of a destination outside the AS, the ABR in the stub
area generates a default route and advertises it to the non-ABR routers in that
stub area.
Note the following when configuring a stub area:
● The backbone area cannot be configured as a stub area.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 389
● All routers in a stub area must be configured with the stub command.
● ASBRs cannot exist in stub areas, because it is not allowed to flood external
routes in stub areas.
● A virtual link cannot pass through a stub area.
OSPFv3 Route Summarization
Routing summarization decreases the amount of routing information and the size
of routing tables, improving the performance of routers.
The following is a description of OSPFv3 route summarization:
● Inter-area route summarization
Inter-area route summarization is performed on ABRs and applies to routes
from within an AS. An ABR generates Network-summary (Type 3) LSAs by
network segment while advertising routing information to other areas. If
network segments are contiguous, the ABR can summarize them into a single
segment. This allows the ABR to send only the summary LSA for all the
specified network segments.
● External route summarization
External route summarization is performed on ASBRs and is specific to
external routes that are imported into OSPF. ASBRs can summarize imported
AS-external (Type 5) LSAs within a summary address range. After an NSSA is
configured, an ASBR must summarize imported NSSA (Type 7) LSAs with the
summary address range.
Devices that are both ABRs and ASBRs summarize the Type 5 LSAs translated
from Type 7 LSAs.
OSPFv3 Virtual Link
A virtual link is a logical channel set up between two ABRs through a non-
backbone area.
● It must be configured on both ends of the link to take effect.
● The non-backbone area that provides an internal route for both the ends of
the virtual link is a transit area.
Non-backbone areas cannot always physically connect to the backbone area in
real-world situations. Configuring OSPFv3 virtual links resolves this problem.
A virtual link functions as a point-to-point connection between two ABRs. The
interfaces on the virtual link can be configured with parameters such as the hello
interval in the same way they are configured on physical interfaces.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 390
Figure 6-2 shows the transmission of OSPFv3 packets between two ABRs. OSPFv3
devices between the two ABRs only transparently forward the OSPFv3 packets as
common IP packets when they detect that they are not the destinations of the
packets.
OSPFv3 Multi-Process
Multiple OSPFv3 processes can run on the same router because they are
independent of each other. Route interaction between different OSPFv3 processes
is similar to that between different routing protocols.
One interface on a router belongs to only one OSPFv3 process.
6.2.2 OSPFv3 GR
Graceful restart (GR) is a high availability (HA) technology used to ensure normal
traffic forwarding when a routing protocol restarts and guarantee that key services
are not affected in the process.
GR comprises a series of comprehensive technologies including fault-tolerant
redundancy, link protection, faulty node recovery, and traffic engineering. As a
redundancy technology, GR is widely used to ensure uninterrupted forwarding of
key data during active/standby switchovers and system upgrades.
If GR is not enabled, an active/standby switchover leads to intermittent
interruption of data forwarding. As a result, route flapping occurs on the whole
network. This is unacceptable on a large-scale network, especially on a carrier
network.
If GR is enabled, the forwarding plane continues to direct data forwarding when a
restart occurs. Then actions on the control plane, such as reestablishment of
neighbor relationships and route calculation, do not affect the forwarding plane.
Service interruption caused by route flapping is therefore prevented, which
improves network reliability.
Basic Concepts
● Grace-LSA
– OSPFv3 supports GR by flooding Grace-LSAs on the link.
– Grace-LSAs are used when GR starts and ends to inform neighbors of the
GR time, cause, and interface instance ID.
● Router role
– A router can function as a GR restarter, which has the GR capability and
restarts in GR mode.
– A router can function as a GR helper, which also has the GR capability
and helps the GR restarter to complete the GR process.
● GR implementation
– Planned GR: This refers to a graceful restart of OSPFv3 through the reset
ospfv3 graceful-restart command. In this mode, a Grace-LSA is sent to
the neighbor before the restart.

– Unplanned GR: This refers to an active/standby switchover triggered by
router faults, such as loss of power, dead loops, exceptions, or master
resets.
Unlike planned GR, a Grace-LSA is not sent before the active/standby
switchover. Instead, the switchover is performed directly. When the
standby board becomes Up, a Grace-LSA is sent, and the GR process
starts.

● On the GR restarter:
1. In planned GR mode, the GR restarter sends a Grace-LSA to all neighbors to
inform them of the restart of a GR process and the duration and cause of this
process.
In unplanned GR mode, a Grace-LSA is sent to each neighbor immediately
after the standby board is Up. This informs the neighbors of the restart of a
GR process and the duration and cause of this process.
2. The GR restarter sets up new neighbor relationships by negotiating with
neighbors again.
3. When all neighbor relationships between the GR restarter and the original
neighbors enter the Full state:
– The GR restarter exits the GR process and OSPFv3 recalculates routes.
– The GR restarter updates its routing table on the main control board and
the forwarding information bases (FIBs) on interface boards. It also
deletes invalid routing entries.
– The GR restarter sends a Grace-LSA with an aging time of 3600 seconds
to instruct the GR helper to exit the GR process.
The GR process is now complete.
4. If errors occur during a GR process, the GR timer expires, or a neighbor
relationship fails to enter the Full state during the GR process, the GR
restarter exits the process and OSPFv3 is restarted in non-GR mode. This
causes packets loss.
● On the GR helper:
1. A router that is configured to support the GR process on its neighbor enters
the helper mode after receiving a Grace-LSA.
2. The GR helper maintains its neighbor relationship with the GR restarter, and
the status of the neighbor relationship does not change.
3. If the GR helper continues to receive Grace-LSAs whose GR period differs from
its own GR period, the GR helper updates its GR period to match that of the
received Grace-LSAs.
4. After the GR restarter informs the helper of the success of the GR process
through a Grace-LSA with an aging time of 3600 seconds, the GR helper exits
the GR process.
5. If errors occur during the GR process, the GR helper exits the helper state and
deletes invalid routes after route calculation.

6.2.3 OSPFv3-BGP Synchronization
When a router is restarted or a new router is deployed on a network, network
traffic may be lost during Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) convergence. This is
because IGP convergence is faster than BGP convergence. OSPFv3-BGP
synchronization can solve this problem.
When a router on a BGP network recovers from a fault, BGP convergence is
performed again. Packets may be lost during the convergence.
Figure 6-5 shows traffic traversing a BGP network, passing through Router C from
RouterA to RouterD.
Figure 6-5 Traffic traversing a BGP network
If a fault occurs on RouterC, traffic is redirected to RouterB after rerouting. Packets
are lost when RouterC is restored to normal operating status.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 394
This is because OSPFv3 convergence is already complete when RouterC recovers,
and RouterC becomes the next hop on the route from RouterA to RouterD.
However, at this point, BGP convergence on RouterC is not complete, so RouterC
does not yet know the route to RouterD.
For this reason, when packets destined for RouterD are transmitted from RouterA
to RouterC, they are discarded by RouterC because it has no route to RouterD. This
is shown in Figure 6-6.
Figure 6-6 Packet loss upon device restart without OSPFv3-BGP synchronization
Process of OSPFv3-BGP synchronization
When a router enabled with OSPFv3-BGP synchronization restarts, it advertises a
message in the local OSPFv3 area instructing other routers not to use it as a
transit router.
At the same time, the router sets the cost value in its LSAs to 65535, the largest
value. This ensures that it is not used by other routers as a transit router. The BGP
route, however, can still reach the router.
6.2.4 OSPFv3 Neighbor Relationship Flapping Suppression
OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression works by delaying OSPFv3
neighbor relationship reestablishment or setting the link cost to the maximum
value (65535).
Background
If the status of an interface carrying OSPFv3 services alternates between Up and
Down, OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping occurs on the interface. During the
flapping, OSPFv3 frequently sends Hello packets to reestablish the neighbor
relationship, synchronizes LSDBs, and recalculates routes. In this process, a large
number of packets are exchanged, adversely affecting neighbor relationship
stability, OSPFv3 services, and other OSPFv3-dependent services, such as LDP and
BGP. OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression can address this problem
by delaying OSPFv3 neighbor relationship reestablishment or preventing service
traffic from passing through flapping links.

Related Concepts
Flapping_event: reported when the status of a neighbor relationship on an
interface last changes from Full to a non-Full state. The flapping_event triggers
flapping detection.
Flapping_count: number of times flapping has occurred.
Detect-interval: detection interval. The interval is used to determine whether to
trigger a valid flapping_event.
Threshold: flapping suppression threshold. When the flapping_count reaches or
exceeds threshold, flapping suppression takes effect.
Resume-interval: interval for exiting from OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping
suppression. If the interval between two successive valid flapping_events is longer
than resume-interval, the flapping_count is reset.
Implementation
Flapping detection
Each OSPFv3 interface on which OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping
suppression is enabled starts a flapping counter. If the interval between two
flapping_events is shorter than the detect-interval, a valid flapping_event is
recorded, and the flapping_count is incremented by 1. When the flapping_count
reaches or exceeds threshold, flapping suppression takes effect. If the interval
between two successive neighbor status changes from Full to a non-Full state is
longer than resume-interval, the flapping_count is reset.
The detecting-interval, threshold, and resume-interval are configurable.
NOTE
The value of resume-interval must be greater than that of detecting-interval.
Flapping suppression
Flapping suppression works in either Hold-down or Hold-max-cost mode.
● Hold-down mode: In the case of frequent flooding and topology changes
during neighbor relationship establishment, interfaces prevent neighbor
relationships from being reestablished during the suppression period, which
minimizes LSDB synchronization attempts and packet exchanges.
● Hold-max-cost mode: If the traffic forwarding path changes frequently,
interfaces use 65535 as the cost of the flapping link during Hold-max-cost
suppression, which prevents traffic from passing through the flapping link.
Flapping suppression can also work first in Hold-down mode and then in Hold-
max-cost mode.
By default, the Hold-max-cost mode takes effect. The mode and suppression
duration can be changed manually.
If an attack causes frequent neighbor relationship flapping, Hold-down mode can
minimize the impact of the attack.

NOTE
When an interface enters the flapping suppression state, all neighbor relationships on the
interface enter the state accordingly.
Exiting from flapping suppression
Interfaces exit from flapping suppression in the following scenarios:
● The suppression timer expires.
● The corresponding OSPFv3 process is reset.
● An OSPFv3 neighbor is reset.
● OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression is disabled globally.
● A command is run to exit from flapping suppression.
Typical Scenarios
Basic scenario
In Figure 6-7, the traffic forwarding path is SwitchA -> SwitchB -> SwitchC ->
SwitchE before a link failure occurs. After the link between SwitchB and SwitchC
fails, the forwarding path switches to SwitchA -> SwitchB -> SwitchD -> SwitchE. If
the neighbor relationship between SwitchB and SwitchC frequently flaps at the
early stage of the path switchover, the forwarding path will be switched
frequently, causing traffic loss and affecting network stability. If the neighbor
relationship flapping meets suppression conditions, flapping suppression takes
effect.
● If flapping suppression works in Hold-down mode, the neighbor relationship
between SwitchB and SwitchC is prevented from being reestablished during
the suppression period, in which traffic is forwarded along the path SwitchA -
> SwitchB -> SwitchD -> SwitchE.
● If flapping suppression works in Hold-max-cost mode, 65535 is used as the
cost of the link between SwitchB and SwitchC during the suppression period,
and traffic is forwarded along the path SwitchA -> SwitchB -> SwitchD ->
SwitchE.

Single-forwarding path scenario
When only one forwarding path exists on the network, the flapping of the
neighbor relationship between any two switches on the path will interrupt traffic
forwarding. In Figure 6-8, the traffic forwarding path is SwitchA -> SwitchB ->
SwitchC -> SwitchE. If the neighbor relationship between SwitchB and SwitchC
flaps, and the flapping meets suppression conditions, flapping suppression takes
effect. However, if the neighbor relationship between SwitchB and SwitchC is
prevented from being reestablished, the whole network will be divided. Therefore,
Hold-max-cost mode (rather than Hold-down mode) is recommended. If flapping
suppression works in Hold-max-cost mode, 65535 is used as the cost of the link
between SwitchB and SwitchC during the suppression period. After the network
stabilizes and the suppression timer expires, the link is restored.
NOTE
By default, the Hold-max-cost mode takes effect.
Figure 6-8 Flapping suppression in a single-forwarding path scenario
Broadcast scenario
In Figure 6-9, four switches are deployed on the same broadcast network using
switches, and the switches are broadcast network neighbors. If SwitchC flaps due
to a link failure, and SwitchA and SwitchB were deployed at different time
(SwitchA was deployed earlier for example) or the flapping suppression
parameters on SwitchA and SwitchB are different, SwitchA first detects the
flapping and suppresses SwitchC. Consequently, the Hello packets sent by SwitchA
do not carry SwitchC's Switch ID. However, SwitchB has not detected the flapping
yet and still considers SwitchC a valid node. As a result, the DR candidates
identified by SwitchA are SwitchB and SwitchD, whereas the DR candidates
identified by SwitchB are SwitchA, SwitchC, and SwitchD. Different DR candidates
result in a different DR election result, which may lead to route calculation errors.
To prevent this problem in scenarios where an interface has multiple neighbors,
such as on a broadcast, P2MP, or NBMA network, all neighbors on the interface
are suppressed when the status of a neighbor relationship last changes to ExStart
or Down. Specifically, if SwitchC flaps, SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchD on the
broadcast network are all suppressed. After the network stabilizes and the
suppression timer expires, SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchD are restored to normal
status.

Figure 6-9 Flapping suppression on a broadcast network
Multi-area scenario
In Figure 6-10, SwitchA, SwitchB, SwitchC, SwitchE, and SwitchF are connected in
area 1, and SwitchB, SwitchD, and SwitchE are connected in backbone area 0.
Traffic from SwitchA to SwitchF is preferentially forwarded along an intra-area
route, and the forwarding path is SwitchA -> SwitchB -> SwitchC -> SwitchE ->
SwitchF. When the neighbor relationship between SwitchB and SwitchC flaps and
the flapping meets suppression conditions, flapping suppression takes effect in the
default mode (Hold-max-cost). However, the forwarding path remains unchanged
because intra-area routes take precedence over inter-area routes during route
selection according to OSPFv3 route selection rules. To prevent traffic loss in
multi-area scenarios, configure Hold-down mode to prevent the neighbor
relationship between SwitchB and SwitchC from being reestablished during the
suppression period. During this period, traffic is forwarded along the path SwitchA
-> SwitchB -> SwitchD -> SwitchE -> SwitchF.
NOTE
By default, the Hold-max-cost mode takes effect. The mode can be changed to Hold-down
manually.

6.2.5 OSPFv3 and OSPFv2 Comparison
The following aspects of OSPFv3 and OSPFv2 are the same:
● Network type and interface type
● Interface state machine and neighbor state machine
● LSDB
● Flooding mechanism
● Hello, DD, LSR, LSU, and LSAck packets
● Route calculation
The following aspects of OSPFv3 and OSPFv2 are different:
● OSPFv3 runs on IPv6, which is based on links rather than network segments.
This means that there is no need to configure OSPFv3 on interfaces in the
same network segment. It is only necessary that the interfaces enabled with
OSPFv3 are on the same link. Interfaces can also set up OSPFv3 sessions
without IPv6 global addresses.
● OSPFv3 does not depend on IP addresses.
This separates topology calculation from IP addresses. OSPFv3 calculates a
topology without knowing the IPv6 global address, which only applies to
virtual link interfaces for packet forwarding.
● OSPFv3 packets and the LSA format have the following changes:
– OSPFv3 packets do not contain IP addresses.
– OSPFv3 router LSAs and network LSAs do not contain IP addresses, which
are advertised by Type 8 LSAs and Type 9 LSAs.
– In OSPFv3, router IDs, area IDs, and LSA link state IDs no longer indicate
IP addresses, but the IPv4 address format is still reserved.
– In broadcast, NBMA, or P2MP networks, neighbors are identified by
router IDs instead of IP addresses.
● In OSPFv3, information about the flooding scope is added in the LSA Type
field.
This allows OSPFv3 routers to process LSAs of unidentified types, which
makes processing more flexible.
– OSPFv3 stores or floods unidentified packets, whereas OSPFv2 discards.
– OSPFv3 floods packets in an OSPF area or on a link. It sets the U flag bit
of packets (the flooding area is based on the link local) so that
unidentified packets are stored or forwarded to the stub area.
For example, RouterA and RouterB can identify LSA of a certain type. They are
connected through RouterC, which cannot identify this type of LSA. When
RouterA floods an LSA of this type, RouterC still floods it to RouterB even
though it cannot identify the LSA itself. RouterB then processes the LSA
normally.
If this occurred over OSPFv2, RouterC would discard the unidentified LSA, and
it would not reach RouterB.
● OSPFv3 supports multi-process on a link.
Only one OSPFv2 process can be configured on a physical interface, but
multiple OSPFv3 processes can be configured a single physical interface.
S300, S500, S2700, S5700 and S6700 Series Ethernet
Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 400
These processes are identified by different instance IDs. They establish
neighbor relationships with the other end of the link and transmit packets to
the other end without interfering with each other.
The resources of a link can therefore be shared among OSPFv3 instances that
simulate multiple OSPFv3 routers. This allows more efficient use of limited
router resources.
● OSPFv3 uses IPv6 link-local addresses.
IPv6 implements neighbor discovery and automatic configuration based on
link-local addresses. Routers running IPv6 do not forward IPv6 packets whose
destination address is a link-local address. Those packets can only be
exchanged on the same link. The unicast link-local address starts from
FE80::/10.
As a routing protocol running on IPv6, OSPFv3 uses link-local addresses to
maintain neighbor relationships and update LSDBs. All OSPFv3 interfaces,
except Vlink interfaces, use link-local addresses as the source address and the
next hop address to transmit OSPFv3 packets.
The advantages are as follows:
– The OSPFv3 can calculate the topology without knowing the global IPv6
addresses.
– The packets flooded on a link are not transmitted to other links, which
prevents unnecessary flooding and saves bandwidth.
● OSPFv3 supports the following two new LSAs:
– Type 8 (Link) LSA: A router floods a link LSA on the link where it resides
to advertise its link-local address and the configured global IPv6 address.
– Type 9 (Intra-Area-Prefix) LSA: A router advertises an intra-area-prefix
LSA in the local OSPF area to inform other routers in the area or network
of its IPv6 global address. The network can be a broadcast network or an
NBMA network.
● OSPFv3 identifies neighbors based only on router IDs.
OSPF identifies neighbors based on IPv4 interface addresses in broadcast,
NBMA, P2P, and P2MP networks and identifies neighbors based on router IDs
in Vlink networks.
Since OSPFv3 identifies neighbors based only on router IDs, it can establish
and maintain neighbor relationships even when global IPv6 addresses are not
configured or are configured in different network segments. Topology
calculation is not based on IP addresses.

6.6 Configuring Basic OSPFv3 Functions
Applicable Environment
Configure basic OSPFv3 functions before building OSPFv3 networks. Enable
OSPFv3 and specify the interface, area ID, and router ID before configuring other
functions.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring basic OSPFv3 functions, complete the following tasks:
● Enable IPv6 capabilities.
● Make the network layers of the adjacent nodes accessible.
6.6.1 Enabling OSPFv3
Context
OSPFv3 supports multiple processes on a switch. These processes are
differentiated by process IDs. A process ID is set when OSPFv3 is enabled and is
only locally valid. It does not affect packet exchange with other switches.
A router ID is a 32-bit unsigned integer that uniquely identifies a switch within an
AS. It is expressed in the IPv4 address format. OSPFv3 router IDs must be
manually set. If the router ID is not set, OSPFv3 cannot function normally.

Switches
Configuration Guide - IP Unicast Routing 6 OSPFv3 Configuration
Issue 01 (2024-09-30) Copyright © Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 405
Ensure that the router IDs of switches in an AS are all different. When multiple
OSPFv3 processes are enabled on a switch, specify a unique router ID for each
process.
Plan router IDs and manually configure them to ensure the stable operation of
OSPFv3.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 [
process-id ] [ vpn-instance
vpn-instance-name ]
OSPFv3 is enabled, and the OSPFv3 view is displayed.
Step 3 Run router-id
router-id
A router ID is set.
When configuring a router ID, ensure that the router ID is unique in an AS. You
can select the IP address of an interface as the router ID.
NOTE
If router IDs conflict in an OSPFv3 process, routers cannot establish OSPFv3 neighbor
relationships, and the routing information is incorrect.
If a router ID conflict occurs, perform either of the following operations:
● Reconfigure a router ID.
● Run the undo ospfv3 router-id auto-recover disable command to enable the
switch to automatically change the conflicted router ID to its own IP address.
NOTE
– After the undo ospfv3 router-id auto-recover disable command is run, the conflicting
router ID will be changed.
– After the router ID is changed, if the new router ID still conflicts with another one, the
switch is allowed to reconfigure one for a maximum of three times.
----End
6.6.2 Enabling OSPFv3 on an Interface
Context
After enabling OSPFv3 in the system view, enable OSPFv3 on an interface.
Because an interface has multiple instances, specify in which instance OSPFv3 is
enabled. If no instance ID is specified, the value defaults to 0. The same instance
must be enabled on interfaces between which the neighbor relationship is set up.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.

Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run interface
interface-type interface-number
The interface view is displayed.
Step 3 (Optional) On an Ethernet interface, run undo portswitch
The interface is switched to Layer 3 mode.
By default, an Ethernet interface works in Layer 2 mode.
NOTE
Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H,
S6730-S, and S6730S-S support switching between Layer 2 and Layer 3 modes.
Step 4 Run ospfv3
process-id area
area-id [ instance
instance-id ]
OSPFv3 is enabled on the interface.
The area ID can be entered as a decimal integer or in the IPv4 address format, but
it is always displayed in the IPv4 address format.
Step 5 (Optional) Run the ospfv3 network-type { broadcast | nbma | p2mp [ non-
broadcast ] | p2p } [ instance
instance-id ] command to configure a network type
for the interface.
NOTE
When an interface supports multi-instances, you must specify the value of
instance-id when
enabling OSPFv3 on the interface. If the value of
instance-id is not specified, the default value 0
is used. In this case, the configured network type of an interface may not match the actual
network type of the interface. This step is mandatory in such a case.
----End
6.6.3 Entering an OSPFv3 Area View
Context
When configuring OSPFv3 switches in the same area, uniformly plan the
configuration data. Otherwise, neighbor switches cannot exchange information
with each other. This causes congestion of routing information or routing loops.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 [
process-id ] [ vpn-instance
vpn-instance-name ]
The OSPFv3 view is displayed.

Step 3 Run area
area-id
The OSPFv3 area view is displayed.
The area ID can be entered as a decimal integer or in the IPv4 address format.
However, it is displayed in the IPv4 address format.
An OSPFv3 area cannot be manually deleted. It is automatically deleted only after
all the configurations in the area view are cleared.
----End
6.6.4 (Optional) Configuring a Route Selection Rule
Context
RFC 5340 and RFC 1583 define route selection rules differently. After OSPFv3 is
enabled on a switch, you need to specify a route selection rule based on the
switch configuration. By default, a switch complies with the route selection rule
defined in RFC 5340. If the neighboring switch complies with the route selection
rule defined in RFC 1583, you need to configure the local switch to comply with
that defined in RFC 1583. This allows all switches in an OSPFv3 area to comply
with the same route selection rule.
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospf [
process-id ] [ vpn-instance
vpn-instance-name ]
The OSPF process view is displayed.
Step 3 Run rfc1583 compatible
The device is configured to comply with the route selection rules defined in RFC
1583, rather than RFC 5340.
By default, the switch complies with the route selection rules defined in RFC 5340.
----End
6.6.5 Verifying the Basic OSPFv3 Function Configuration
Prerequisites
Configuring basic OSPFv3 functions is complete.

6.7 Establishing and Maintaining an OSPFv3 Neighbor
Relationship
Applicable Environment
Establishing and maintaining OSPFv3 neighbor relationships is necessary for the
construction of an OSPFv3 network. The configurations in this section allow you
to:
● Modify OSPFv3 timers to adjust the convergence speed of the OSPFv3
network and the network load caused by protocol packets.
● Configure the OSPFv3 retransmission limitation to prevent non-stop packet
retransmissions if the neighbor does not receive packets.
● Adjust the intervals for updating and receiving LSAs to speed up the
convergence of an OSPFv3 network.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before establishing or maintaining an OSPFv3 neighbor relationship, configure
basic OSPFv3 functions.

Step 4 Run ospfv3 timer retransmit
interval [ instance
instance-id ]
The interval for retransmitting LSAs to adjacent switches is set.
The value of
interval must be greater than the round trip time of one packet
transmitted between two switches.
NOTE
An excessively small LSA retransmission can cause unnecessary retransmissions.
----End
6.7.4 Configuring an LSA Transmission Delay
Context
LSAs age in the LSDB of a local switch but do not age in the transmission process.
Set a delay for LSA transmission. This is a necessary configuration for low-speed
networks.

6.7.5 Verifying the OSPFv3 Neighbor Relationship
Establishment and Maintenance Configuration
Prerequisites
The configurations for establishing and maintaining an OSPFv3 neighbor
relationship have been completed.
Procedure
● Run the display ospfv3 [
process-id ] interface [ area
area-id ] [
interface-
type interface-number ] command to check the OSPFv3 interface information.
----End
6.8 Configuring an OSPFv3 Area
Applicable Environment
Define OSPFv3 areas to reduce the number of LSAs in the network and enhance
OSPFv3 extensibility. To further reduce the size of routing tables and number of
LSAs, specify some non-backbone areas at the edge of ASs as stub areas.
Pre-configuration Tasks
Before configuring OSPFv3 area attributes, configure basic OSPFv3 functions.

6.8.1 Configuring an OSPFv3 Stub Area
Context
Perform the following operations on each switch that runs OSPFv3 in the area
that will be configured as a stub area:
Procedure
Step 1 Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
Step 2 Run ospfv3 [
process-id ]
The OSPFv3 view is displayed.
Step 3 Run area
area-id
The OSPFv3 area view is displayed.
Step 4 Run stub [ no-summary ]
The area is configured as a stub area.
Step 5 (Optional) Run default-cost
cost
The cost of the default route sent to the stub area is set.
By default, this cost is 1.
Perform this step only on the ABR in the stub area.
The parameter no-summary takes effect only when the stub command is
configured on the ABR. If this parameter is configured, the ABR only sends the
summary-LSA of a default route to the stub area. It does not generate other
summary-LSAs, such as AS-external-LSAs or Summary-LSAs. This area is called a
totally stub area.
----End
6.8.2 Configuring OSPFv3 Virtual Links
Context
After an OSPFv3 area is defined, OSPFv3 route updates between non-backbone
areas are implemented through a backbone area. OSPFv3 requires all non-
backbone areas to maintain connectivity with the backbone area and the
backbone area to maintain its own connectivity as well. If this requirement cannot
be met, configure OSPFv3 virtual links.
A virtual link must be configured at both ends of the link, or it will not take effect.
Perform the following operations on the switch that runs OSPFv3.
