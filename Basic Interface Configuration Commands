Command Support

Commands provided in this section and all the parameters in the commands are supported by all switch models (except the S5751-L, S5731-L, and S5731S-L), unless otherwise specified. For details, see specific commands.
collect counters top
Function

The collect counters top command sets the parameters for top N interface traffic statistics and enables the function to generate top N interface traffic statistics reports.
Format

collect counters top [ number ] interface { interface-type | all | layer-2 | layer-3 } [ sort-by statistics-type | interval interval-value ] *
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

number
	

Specifies the number of busiest interfaces for which traffic statistics reports are to be generated.

For example, if the value is 10, a traffic statistics report about top 10 busiest interfaces is generated.

If you do not specify this parameter, a traffic statistics report about top 20 busiest interfaces is generated.
	

The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 50000.

interface { interface-type | all | layer-2 | layer-3 }
	

Specifies the type of the interfaces for which a top N traffic statistics report is to be generated:

    interface-type: indicates a specific type of interface.
    all: indicates all interfaces.
    layer-2: indicates Layer 2 interfaces.
    layer-3: indicates Layer 3 interfaces.

	

The specified interfaces must be Ethernet physical interfaces or Eth-Trunk interfaces.

sort-by statistics-type
	

Specifies the statistics type by which ports are determined to be the busiest.

If you do not specify sort-by statistics-type, statistics are sorted by the total number of bytes in descending order.
	
The value can be:

    utilization: indicates to sort statistics by bandwidth utilization.
    bytes: indicates to sort statistics by the total number of bytes.
    packets: indicates to sort statistics by the total number of packets.
    multicast: indicates to sort statistics by the total number of multicast packets.
    broadcast: indicates to sort statistics by the total number of broadcast packets.
    errors: indicates to sort statistics by the total number of error packets.
    discards: indicates to sort statistics by the total number of dropped packets.

interval interval-value
	

Specifies the interval at which statistics are collected.
	

The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 999, in seconds. The default value is 30.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The display command allows you to view statistics about the traffic sent and received by each interface on a device, but cannot sort these statistics by traffic volume in descending order. The display counters top interface command allows you to view top N interface traffic statistics reports, facilitating interface monitoring. Before you view a top N interface traffic statistics report, run the collect counters top command to generate your desired top N interface traffic statistics report. For example, configure the device to generate a top N statistics report about packets dropped on Layer 2 interfaces within 50s.

The top N interface traffic statistics function sorts statistics about inbound and outbound traffic processed by interfaces within a collection interval in descending order and generates a top N interface traffic statistics report. The device stops collecting interface traffic statistics after the collection interval ends. To generate another top N interface traffic statistics report, run the collect counters top command again.

Configuration Impact

    After the collect counters top command is run, the device collects interface traffic statistics and generates a top N interface traffic statistics report based on the set parameters.
    The collect counters top command configuration is not saved in the configuration file.

Follow-up Procedure

To view a top N interface traffic statistics report, run the display counters top interface command.
Precautions

    When the master switch in a stack containing multiple member switches is faulty, the top N interface traffic statistics function takes effect only on a master switch. If the master switch encounters a fault and switches to the backup state, run the collect counters top command on the new master switch again.
    The collect counters top command can be run multiple times in succession with different parameters specified. For example, you can configure a device to generate a top N statistics report about interface multicast packets when the device is still generating a top N statistics report about interface broadcast packets.
    The top N interface traffic statistics function allows a device to generate a maximum of five top N interface traffic statistics reports. If you want the device to generate new top N interface traffic statistics reports when five top N interface traffic statistics reports already exist, run the reset counters top interface command to clear existing ones.

Example
# Configure a device to generate a statistics report about top 10 Layer 2 interfaces in terms of the number of packets dropped within 40s.

<HUAWEI> collect counters top 10 interface layer-2 sort-by discards interval 40

bandwidth (Interface view)
Function

The bandwidth command sets the interface bandwidth obtained by the NMS from the MIB.

The undo bandwidth command restores the default configuration.

By default, the interface bandwidth obtained by the NMS from the MIB depends on the interface type. For example, the bandwidth of a GE interface is 1000 Mbit/s.

Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support this command.
Format

bandwidth bandwidth [ kbps ]

undo bandwidth
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

bandwidth
	

Specifies the bandwidth of an interface.
	

The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 1000000, and the unit is Mbit/s.

kbps
	

Indicates the unit of an interface bandwidth is kbit/s.

If kbps is not specified, the unit of an interface bandwidth is Mbit/s.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario
Running the bandwidth command sets an interface bandwidth obtained by the NMS from the MIB and does not change an interface actual bandwidth. The NMS can check the interface bandwidth through the two objects ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed in IF-MIB.

    If the configured bandwidth is smaller than 4000 Mbit/s, ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed are respectively displayed as bandwidth x 1000 x 1000 and bandwidth.
    If the configured bandwidth is equal to or larger than 4000 Mbit/s, ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed are respectively displayed as 4294967295 (0XFFFFFFFF) and bandwidth.

Precautions

For a VLANIF interface, no matter how many physical interfaces are added to the VLAN corresponding to the VLANIF interface, the interface bandwidth obtained by the NMS from the MIB is always 1000 Mbit/s.
Example

# Set the bandwidth of GE0/0/1 to 100 Mbit/s.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] interface gigabitethernet0/0/1

description (interface view)
Function

The description command configures the description for an interface.

The undo description command restores the default description of an interface.

By default, the description of an interface is null.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

You can run the display counters command to view incoming or outgoing traffic statistics based on the interface type for fault location.

Precautions

Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support sub-interfaces.
When a device has a large number of interfaces, you are advised to specify the interface type in the display counters command to view only desired information. If you do not specify those parameters, the following faults will occur:

    The displayed information is repeatedly refreshed, causing desired information unable to be obtained.
    The system does not respond because of long-time information traversing and searching.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

You can run the display counters rate command to view the incoming or outgoing traffic rate based on the interface type for fault location.

Precautions

After the system is started, in the case of the first query or when the interval with the last query is longer than 600s, the system re-initiates rate statistics collection. In this case, you need to wait until the rate statistics collection result is displayed.

The minimum statistics collection interval is 5 seconds. If the interval is less than 5 seconds, the data collected last time is displayed.
When a device has a large number of interfaces, you are advised to specify the interface type in the display counters rate command to view only desired information. If you do not specify those parameters, the following faults will occur:

    The displayed information is repeatedly refreshed, causing desired information unable to be obtained.
    The system does not respond because of long-time information traversing and searching.

Usage Scenario

The running status and statistics of an interface includes the physical status, basic configuration, and statistics about forwarded packets on the interface. You can use the display interface command to collect traffic statistics or locate faults on an interface.

Precautions

    If no interface type is specified, the running status and statistics of all the interfaces is displayed. If the interface type is specified but no interface number is specified, the running status of all the interfaces of this type is displayed.

    When the XGE service interface of the S5731-H includes Ignoreds, Runts, and Fragments packets, the bytes statistics are incorrect.

    Only the S5731-H, S5731-S, S5731S-H, S5731S-S, S5732-H, S6735-S, S6730-H, S6730S-H, S6730-S, and S6730S-S support sub-interfaces.

Description

current state
	
Current status of the interface:

    UP: The interface is physically Up.

    DOWN: The interface is physically Down.

    Protected port: An interface is added to an interface protection group and set to be a protected interface. To add an interface to an interface protection group and set the interface to be a protected interface, run the port protect-group and protect-group member commands.

    Administratively down: The administrator has run the shutdown command on the interface.
    TRIGGER DOWN (BFD): When BFD detects a fault, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    TRIGGER DOWN (3AH): When 3AH detects a fault, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    TRIGGER DOWN (1AG): When 1AG detects a fault, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    ERROR DOWN(auto-defend): When the interface receives packets from an attack source, the physical status of the interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(efm-threshold-event): When the number of error frames, error codes, or error frame seconds of EFM OAM detected by the interface reaches or exceeds the threshold within a set period, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    ERROR DOWN(efm-remote-failure): When EFM detects a remote failure, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    ERROR DOWN(bpdu-protection): If an edge interface receives RST BPDUs after BPDU protection is enabled, the physical status of the edge interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(error-statistics): If the system detects that the number of error packets received by the interface exceeds the threshold, the physical status of the interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(transceiver-power-low): If the system detects that the optical power of the interface falls below the configured lower alarm threshold, the physical status of the interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(port-security): When the number of learned MAC address entries reaches the threshold, the interface goes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(mac-address-flapping): When the learned MAC address flaps, the interface goes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(dhcp-packet-overspeed): When the DHCP packet rate of the interface exceeds the threshold, the physical status of the associated interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(link-flap): When the link flaps, the physical status of the associated interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(data-integrity-error): The chip memory identifier has a data integrity error and the physical status of the interface becomes Down.
    LOOPBACK-DETECT DOWN: The interface goes Down due to loopback detection.
    LINK-FLAP DOWN: The interface goes physically Down due to automatic link flapping detection.
    UP(E-TRUNK-DOWN): The Eth-Trunk interface goes Down because of E-Trunk negotiation.

NOTE:

There is a delay before the interface state is reported, so an interface undergoes a short-time intermediate state before it transitions to the ERROR DOWN state. The intermediate state is ERROR DOWN (ERROR DOWN reason), up. This state does not affect functioning of the interface.

When the physical status of the interface is ERROR DOWN(data-integrity-error), perform the following operations:

    Check whether the error-down auto-recovery cause data-integrity-error interval interval-value command has been configured on the switch. If the command has been configured, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 3.
    Check whether the interface restores to Up state after the time specified by interval-value expires. If the interface does not restore to Up state, go to step 3.
    Run the undo shutdown command in the interface view to enable the interface and check whether the interface restores to Up state. If the interface does not restore to Up state, go to step 4.
    Run the reset slot command to restart the switch. After the switch restarts, check whether the interface restores to Up state. If the interface does not restore to Up state, go to step 5.
    Replace the switch.

    DOWN: The link-layer protocol status of the interface is Down or no IP address is assigned to the interface.

    For example, if no IP address is assigned to an IP service-capable interface, its protocol status is Down.
    DOWN (CFM down): CFM detects a fault or receives a fault notification message from its associated module. In this case, the link layer protocol of the interface becomes CFM Down.
    DOWN (EFM down): EFM detects a fault or receives a fault notification message from its associated module. In this case, the link layer protocol of the interface becomes EFM Down.
    DOWN (DLDP down): DLDP detects a fault or receives a fault notification message from its associated module. In this case, the link layer protocol of the interface becomes DLDP Down.
    DOWN (MACsec down): MACsec is not enabled on the peer interface. In this case, the link layer protocol of the interface becomes MACsec Down.
    NOTE:

    DOWN (MACsec down) is displayed only after the MACsec plug-in is installed.

    You can search for Plug-in Usage Guide at the Huawei technical support website (Enterprise Network or Carrier), and choose the desired plug-in usage guide based on the switch model and software version. If you do not have permission to access the website, contact technical support personnel.
    DOWN (Observe-port forwarding down): The interface status becomes Down because the packet forwarding function is disabled on the observing port or in the observing port group where the port resides.
    DOWN(BFD status down): indicates that BFD detects a fault and changes the link status of the interface to BFD DOWN. In this state, the interface discards Layer 2 and Layer 3 packets but permits BFD packets.
    DOWN(Main BFD status down): indicates that BFD detects a fault and changes the link status of the main interface and its sub-interfaces to BFD DOWN. This state is applicable only to sub-interfaces. In this state, Layer 2 and Layer 3 packets are discarded, but BFD packets are permitted.

InUti
	

Average inbound bandwidth usage of an interface within the last 300 seconds.

Average inbound bandwidth usage within the last 300 seconds = Average inbound traffic rate within the last 300 seconds/Interface bandwidth

When the average bandwidth usage is smaller than 0.005% and greater than 0, the value 0 is displayed. When the average bandwidth usage is smaller than 0.01% and greater than 0.005%, the value 0.01% is displayed. When the interface bandwidth becomes lower, for example, the speed command is executed to reduce the bandwidth of an Ethernet interface, the bandwidth usage be displayed as 100% because the traffic volume is not adjusted in time. "--" indicates that an interface does not support the display of bandwidth usage.

OutUti
	

Average outbound bandwidth usage within the last 300 seconds.

Average outbound bandwidth usage within the last 300 seconds = Average outbound traffic rate within the last 300 seconds/Interface bandwidth

When the average bandwidth usage is smaller than 0.005% and greater than 0, the value 0 is displayed. When the average bandwidth usage is smaller than 0.01% and greater than 0.005%, the value 0.01% is displayed. When the interface bandwidth becomes lower, for example, the speed command is executed to reduce the bandwidth of an Ethernet interface, the bandwidth usage may be displayed as 100% because the traffic volume is not adjusted in time. "--" indicates that an interface does not support the display of bandwidth usage.

Usage Scenario

The display interface command can also display the description of an interface. To quickly view the description of an interface, you are advised to use the display interface description command.

Precautions

If no interface type is specified, the description of all interfaces is displayed. If an interface type is specified but no interface number is specified, the description of all interfaces of the specified type is displayed.

If there is a great deal of statistics about traffic on Eth-Trunk interfaces, you are recommended to specify trunk-id to filter output information. Otherwise, a problem may occur due to excessive output information: The displayed information is repeatedly refreshed, and therefore required information cannot be located.

Description

current state
	
Current status of the interface:

    UP: The interface is physically Up.

    DOWN: The interface is physically Down.

    Protected port: An interface is added to an interface protection group and set to be a protected interface. To add an interface to an interface protection group and set the interface to be a protected interface, run the port protect-group and protect-group member commands.

    Administratively down: The administrator has run the shutdown command on the interface.
    TRIGGER DOWN (BFD): When BFD detects a fault, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    TRIGGER DOWN (3AH): When 3AH detects a fault, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    TRIGGER DOWN (1AG): When 1AG detects a fault, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    ERROR DOWN(auto-defend): When the interface receives packets from an attack source, the physical status of the interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(efm-threshold-event): When the number of error frames, error codes, or error frame seconds of EFM OAM detected by the interface reaches or exceeds the threshold within a set period, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    ERROR DOWN(efm-remote-failure): When EFM detects a remote failure, the physical status of the interface becomes Down according to the OAM association.
    ERROR DOWN(bpdu-protection): If an edge interface receives RST BPDUs after BPDU protection is enabled, the physical status of the edge interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(error-statistics): If the system detects that the number of error packets received by the interface exceeds the threshold, the physical status of the interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(transceiver-power-low): If the system detects that the optical power of the interface falls below the configured lower alarm threshold, the physical status of the interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(port-security): When the number of learned MAC address entries reaches the threshold, the interface goes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(mac-address-flapping): When the learned MAC address flaps, the interface goes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(dhcp-packet-overspeed): When the DHCP packet rate of the interface exceeds the threshold, the physical status of the associated interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(link-flap): When the link flaps, the physical status of the associated interface becomes Down.
    ERROR DOWN(data-integrity-error): The chip memory identifier has a data integrity error and the physical status of the interface becomes Down.
    LOOPBACK-DETECT DOWN: The interface goes Down due to loopback detection.
    LINK-FLAP DOWN: The interface goes physically Down due to automatic link flapping detection.
    UP(E-TRUNK-DOWN): The Eth-Trunk interface goes Down because of E-Trunk negotiation.

NOTE:

There is a delay before the interface state is reported, so an interface undergoes a short-time intermediate state before it transitions to the ERROR DOWN state. The intermediate state is ERROR DOWN (ERROR DOWN reason), up. This state does not affect functioning of the interface.

When the physical status of the interface is ERROR DOWN(data-integrity-error), perform the following operations:

    Check whether the error-down auto-recovery cause data-integrity-error interval interval-value command has been configured on the switch. If the command has been configured, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 3.
    Check whether the interface restores to Up state after the time specified by interval-value expires. If the interface does not restore to Up state, go to step 3.
    Run the undo shutdown command in the interface view to enable the interface and check whether the interface restores to Up state. If the interface does not restore to Up state, go to step 4.
    Run the reset slot command to restart the switch. After the switch restarts, check whether the interface restores to Up state. If the interface does not restore to Up state, go to step 5.
    Replace the switch.

Line protocol current state
	
Link layer protocol status of the interface:

    UP: The link layer protocol of the interface is working properly.

    UP (BFD status down): BFD associated with the interface is Down.

    DOWN: The link-layer protocol status of the interface is Down or no IP address is assigned to the interface.

    For example, if no IP address is assigned to an IP service-capable interface, its protocol status is Down.
    DOWN (CFM down): CFM detects a fault or receives a fault notification message from its associated module. In this case, the link layer protocol of the interface becomes CFM Down.
    DOWN (EFM down): EFM detects a fault or receives a fault notification message from its associated module. In this case, the link layer protocol of the interface becomes EFM Down.
    DOWN (DLDP down): DLDP detects a fault or receives a fault notification message from its associated module. In this case, the link layer protocol of the interface becomes DLDP Down.
    DOWN (MACsec down): MACsec is not enabled on the peer interface. In this case, the link layer protocol of the interface becomes MACsec Down.
    NOTE:

    DOWN (MACsec down) is displayed only after the MACsec plug-in is installed.

    You can search for Plug-in Usage Guide at the Huawei technical support website (Enterprise Network or Carrier), and choose the desired plug-in usage guide based on the switch model and software version. If you do not have permission to access the website, contact technical support personnel.
    DOWN (Observe-port forwarding down): The interface status becomes Down because the packet forwarding function is disabled on the observing port or in the observing port group where the port resides.
    DOWN(BFD status down): indicates that BFD detects a fault and changes the link status of the interface to BFD DOWN. In this state, the interface discards Layer 2 and Layer 3 packets but permits BFD packets.
    DOWN(Main BFD status down): indicates that BFD detects a fault and changes the link status of the main interface and its sub-interfaces to BFD DOWN. This state is applicable only to sub-interfaces. In this state, Layer 2 and Layer 3 packets are discarded, but BFD packets are permitted.

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) determines the maximum number of bytes in IP packets each time a sender can send. The MTU of an IP packet refers to the number of bytes from the IP header of the packet to the data.

The size of data frames is limited at the network layer. Any time the IP layer receives an IP packet to be sent, it checks to which local interface the packet needs to be sent and obtains the MTU configured on the interface. Generally, the IP layer compares the MTU with the packet length. If the packet length is longer than the MTU, the IP layer fragments the packet into smaller packets, which are shorter than or equal to the MTU. If unfragmentation is configured, some packets may be discarded during data transmission at the IP layer. To ensure jumbo packets are not dropped during transmission, you need to configure forcible fragmentation. In this case, you can run the mtu command to set the size of a fragment.

The switch checks the MTU of CPU-forwarded IP packets. If the packet length is greater than the MTU, the switch fragments the packets. When the length of an IP packet forwarded by the chip is greater than the MTU, switches of different models and with different configurations process the packet differently.

Prerequisites

Run the undo portswitch command to change the working mode of Ethernet physical interfaces from Layer 2 mode to Layer 3 mode.

Precautions

    After changing the maximum transmission unit (MTU) using the mtu command on an interface, you need to restart the interface to make the new MTU take effect. To restart the interface, run the shutdown command and then the undo shutdown command, or run the restart command in the interface view.

    If IPv6 is run on a tunnel interface and the MTU set using the mtu command on the interface is smaller than 1280, IPv6 works abnormally on this interface. To prevent this problem, set the MTU of a tunnel interface to a value greater than or equal to 1280 if IPv6 runs on the tunnel interface.

    Configuring the MTU of an interface affects the maximum number of bytes for IP packets to be sent by the interface at a time. This configuration also affects the maximum frame length of sent Ethernet packets. The Ethernet packet size cannot exceed the maximum frame length allowed by the peer interface, which can be set using the jumboframe enable command.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Before collecting traffic statistics on a specific interface within a period in the NMS, clear existing traffic statistics on this interface in the NMS.

For details on how to view interface traffic statistics in the NMS, see the NMS documentation.

Precautions

    If no interface type and number are specified, traffic statistics of all interfaces in the NMS are cleared.

    After you run the reset counters if-mib interface command, traffic statistics on all interfaces in the NMS are cleared. Therefore, confirm the action before you run this command.

    Running the reset counters if-mib interface command does not affect the interface traffic statistics displayed by the display interface command. To clear the interface traffic statistics displayed by the display interface command, run the reset counters interface command.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Before collecting traffic statistics on an interface within a certain period, run the reset counters interface command to clear existing traffic statistics.

Precautions

    Statistics cannot be restored after being cleared. Therefore, exercise caution before clearing the statistics.

    Traffic accounting is based on the packet statistics on an interface. The clearing of the packet statistics on an interface by using the reset counters interface command affects the traffic accounting result. Therefore, do not randomly clear the packet statistics on an interface in a normal application environment.

    If no interface type is specified, traffic statistics on all types of interfaces are cleared. If an interface type is specified but no interface number is specified, traffic statistics on all interfaces of the specified type are cleared.

    Running the reset counters interface command clears the last part of the display interface command output. That is, statistics about received and transmitted packets on the interface are cleared.
    The reset counters interface command does not clear the interface traffic statistics collected by the NMS. To clear such statistics, run the reset counters if-mib interface command.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

By using the set flow-stat interval command to set the interval for collecting traffic statistics on interfaces, you can collect and analyze traffic statistics according to your needs. You can also take traffic control measures based on the traffic statistics to prevent network congestion and service interruption.

    When congestion occurs, set the interval for collecting traffic statistics on an interface to less than 300 seconds, or 30 seconds if congestion worsens. Then observe the traffic distribution on the interface within a short period of time. If data packets cause congestion, take proper measures to control the rate of the packets.

    When the network bandwidth is sufficient and services are running properly, set the interval for collecting traffic statistics on an interface to more than 300 seconds. If the value of any traffic parameter is not within the specified range, change the interval for collecting traffic statistics to observe the traffic volume in real time.

Precautions

    The interval configured in the system view takes effect on all the interfaces that use the default interval.

    The interval configured in the interface view takes effect only on the current interface.

    The interval configured in the interface view takes precedence over the interval configured in the system view.

Example

# Set the interval for collecting traffic statistics on GE0/0/1 to 400s.

Default Level

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

After modifying parameters of an interface, run the shutdown and undo shutdown commands to make the modification take effect.

When an interface is not connected to a cable or fiber, you can use the shutdown command to disable the interface to prevent exceptions caused by interference.

Precautions

    When the device supports the autocomplete function, you must enter at least the characters shut before the device can automatically complete the shutdown command.

    Disabling an interface during data transmission will cause data frame loss or service interruption. Exercise caution when you use the shutdown command.

    Some logical interfaces, such as loopback, and null interfaces, do not support the shutdown and undo shutdown commands.

    If you run the shutdown command in the Eth-Trunk interface view, all Eth-Trunk member interfaces are disabled.

    Running the shutdown and undo shutdown commands is equivalent to running the restart command.

    When an interface is configured with a sub-interface, the default interval for running the shutdown and undo shutdown commands on the main interface is 15 seconds.

    When a physical interface functions as an Eth-Trunk member interface, the default interval for running the shutdown and undo shutdown commands on this interface is 15 seconds.

Example

# Shut down GE0/0/1.
