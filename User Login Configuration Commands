Command Support

Commands provided in this section and all the parameters in the commands are supported by all switch models (except the S5751-L, S5731-L, and S5731S-L), unless otherwise specified. For details, see specific commands.
configuration exclusive
Function

The configuration exclusive command locks the current system configuration. When the system configuration is locked, the user who locks it can query and modify the configuration while other users can only query the configuration.

The undo configuration exclusive command unlocks the system configuration.

By default, the system configuration is unlocked.
Format

configuration exclusive

undo configuration exclusive
Parameters

2: Configuration level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

A device allows several users to log in concurrently to perform manual configurations, which may cause configuration conflicts and service exceptions. To prevent service exceptions, run the configuration exclusive command to lock and modify the configuration. Other users can then only query the configuration.
To unlock the configuration, do either of the following:

    Run the undo configuration exclusive command.
    Do not modify the configuration in the configured lock interval. The system then automatically unlocks the configuration. To configure the lock interval, run the configuration-occupied timeout command.

Precautions

    After you run the configuration exclusive command, other users cannot modify the system configuration, so confirm your action before running this command.
    Before you run the configuration exclusive command, run the configuration-occupied timeout command to configure the maximum lock interval so that the system can automatically unlock the configuration after this interval.

Example
# Lock the current system configuration.

<HUAWEI> configuration exclusive

# Unlock the system configuration.

<HUAWEI> undo configuration exclusive

configuration-occupied timeout
Function

The configuration-occupied timeout command sets the interval after which the system automatically unlocks the configuration.

The undo configuration-occupied timeout command restores the default automatic unlock interval.

By default, the value is 30 seconds.
Format

configuration-occupied timeout timeout-value

undo configuration-occupied timeout
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

timeout-value
	

Specifies the interval after which the system automatically unlocks the configuration if no configuration command is run.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 7200, in seconds. By default, the value is 30 seconds.
Views

Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

The configuration-occupied timeout command configures the longest lock interval. If no configuration command is delivered within this interval, the system automatically unlocks the configuration so that other users can modify the configuration.
The usage scenarios for this command are as follows:

    If the user does not have the configuration right, the system displays an error.
    If the configuration is locked by another user, the system displays a message indicating that the modification fails.
    If the configuration is locked by the user who configures the longest lock interval, the modification is valid.

Note the following when running the configuration-occupied timeout command:

    The interval cannot be too short because the device will automatically unlock the configuration if no configuration command is delivered by the user who configures the interval.
    The interval cannot be too long because other users cannot modify the configuration within this period even if the user who locks the configuration delivers no configuration command within this period.
    The command is valid for all users.

Example
# Set the automatic unlock interval to 120 seconds.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] configuration-occupied timeout 120

console0 disable
Function

The console0 disable command disables the console port login function.

The undo console0 disable command enables the console port login function.

By default, the console port login function is enabled.
Format

console0 disable

undo console0 disable
Parameters
None

Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Application Scenario

By default, the administrator can log in to a switch through the console port. If the console port login function is not required, you can run the console0 disable command to disable this function. If this function is required, you can run the undo console0 disable command to enable this function.

Precautions

After the console0 disable command is run, this command does not take effect for users who have logged in to the device through the console port and takes effect for the users only after they exit from the console port using the quit command.

For devices that have the PNP button, you can press and hold the PNP button to enable the function of logging in through the console port.
Example

# Disable the console port login function.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] console0 disable

Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Compared with RSA, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) has a wider application in the SSH protocol. The asymmetric encryption system generates public and private keys to implement secure key exchange, thereby ensuring secure sessions.

If a DSA key exists, when you run this command, the system prompts you to confirm whether to change the original key. If you agree, the key in the new key pair is named device name_Host_DSA, for example, HUAWEI_Host_DSA. The local DSA private key is saved in PKCS#8 format to the hostkey_dsa file in the system NOR FLASH.

After you enter the command, the device prompts you to enter the number of bits in the host key. The length of a host key pair can be 2048. By default, the key length is 2048.

Precautions

This command is not saved in a configuration file and can take effect immediately after being run. After the device restarts, you do not need to run the command again.

To improve security of the device, it is recommended that you use a key pair of 2048 bits.
Example

# Generate DSA key pairs on the device.

<HUAWEI> system-view

Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

DSA applies to SSH verification. The asymmetric encryption system generates public and private keys to implement secure key exchange, thereby ensuring secure sessions. You can run the dsa local-key-pair create command to generate local DSA keys. When local DSA keys are unnecessary, you can run the dsa local-key-pair destroy command to delete these keys.

Prerequisite

The local DSA keys have been created.

Configuration Impact

After you run this command, the **_DSA file that stores DSA keys on the device is cleared.

Precautions

The dsa local-key-pair destroy command takes effect once, and therefore will not be saved in the configuration file.
Example

# Delete local DSA keys.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When you use a DSA public key for authentication, you must specify the public key of the corresponding client for an SSH user on the server. When the client logs in to the server, the server uses the specified public key to authenticate the client. You can also save the public key generated on the server to the client. Then the client can be successfully authenticated by the server when it logs in to the server for the first time.

Huawei data communications devices support the DER, OpenSSH and PEM formats for DSA keys. If you use a DSA key in non-DER/OpenSSH/PEM format, use a third-party tool to convert the key into a key in DER, OpenSSH or PEM format.

Because a third-party tool is not released with Huawei system software, DSA usability is unsatisfactory. In addition to DER and PEM, DSA keys need to support the OpenSSH format to improve DSA usability.
Third-party software, such as PuTTY, OpenSSH, and OpenSSL, can be used to generate DSA keys in different formats. The details are as follows:

    The PuTTY generate DSA keys in PEM format.
    The OpenSSH generates DSA keys in OpenSSH format.
    The OpenSSL generates DSA keys in DER format.

OpenSSL is an open source software. You can download related documents at the OpenSSL official website.

After you configure an encoding format for a DSA public key, Huawei data communications device automatically generates a DSA public key in the configured encoding format and enters the DSA public key view. Then, you can run the public-key-code begin command and manually copy the DSA public key generated on the peer device to the local device.

Follow-up Procedure
After you copy the DSA public key generated on the peer device to the local device, perform the following operations to exit the DSA public key view:

    Run the public-key-code end command to return to the DSA public key view.
    Run the peer-public-key end command to exit the DSA public key view and return to the system view.

Precautions

When you run the undo dsa peer-public-key command to delete a DSA public key:

    If the public key has been assigned to an SSH client, run the undo ssh user user-name assign { rsa-key | dsa-key | ecc-key } command to release the binding between the public key and the SSH client. If you do not release the binding between them, the undo dsa peer-public-key command will fail to delete the public key.
    If the name of the host public key of the SSH server to be connected is specified on the SSH client, you need to run the undo ssh client servername assign { rsa-key | dsa-key | ecc-key } command to delete the host public key of the SSH server. Otherwise, the DSA public key cannot be deleted.

The peer public key supports only PKCS#1. Other PKCS versions are not supported.

ecc local-key-pair create
Function

The ecc local-key-pair create command generates a local Elliptic Curves Cryptography (ECC) host key pair.
Format

ecc local-key-pair create
Parameters

None
Views

System view
Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

A local key pair is a prerequisite to a successful SSH login. Compared with the RSA algorithm used by the rsa local-key-pair create command, the ECC algorithm shortens the key length, accelerates the encryption, and improves the security. The length of the server key pair and the host key pair can be 256 bits, 384 bits and 521 bits. By default, the length of the key pair is 521 bits.

Precautions

    The generated ECC host key pair is named in the format of switch name_Host_ECC, such as HUAWEI_Host_ECC. The local DSA private key is saved in PKCS#8 format to the hostkey_ecc file in the system NOR FLASH.

    The ecc local-key-pair create and ecc local-key-pair destroy commands are not saved in the configuration file. They only need to be run once and take effect even after the switch restarts.

    Do not delete the ECC key file from the switch. If the ECC key file is deleted, the ECC key pair cannot be restored after the switch is restarted.

Example

# Generate a local ECC host key pair.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When ECC public key authentication is used, a client's public key must be specified on the server for an SSH user. When the client logs in to the server, the server performs authentication on the client based on the public key of the SSH user.

After an ECC public key is created and the ECC public key view is displayed, run the public-key-code begin command, then you can manually copy the client's public key to the server.

The client's public key is randomly generated by the client software.

Follow-up Procedure
After copying the client's ECC public key to the server, run the following commands to quit the ECC public key view:

    Run the public-key-code end command to return to the ECC public key view.
    Run the peer-public-key end command to exit the ECC public key view and return to the system view.

Precautions

A maximum of 20 ECC public keys can be created.

When you run the undo ecc peer-public-key command to delete an ECC public key:

    If the public key has been assigned to an SSH client, run the undo ssh user user-name assign { rsa-key | dsa-key | ecc-key } command to release the binding between the public key and the SSH client. If you do not release the binding between them, the undo dsa peer-public-key command will fail to delete the public key.
    If the name of the host public key of the SSH server to be connected is specified on the SSH client, you need to run the undo ssh client servername assign { rsa-key | dsa-key | ecc-key } command to delete the host public key of the SSH server. Otherwise, the DSA public key cannot be deleted.

The peer public key supports only PKCS#1. Other PKCS versions are not supported.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

After an SSL policy is loaded to an HTTPS server, the HTTPS server provides HTTPS service using SSL. The client and HTTPS server establish an SSL connection to protect user information from theft.

Prerequisites

The web page file has been loaded to the device.

Precautions

    After the HTTPS service is enabled, only authenticated users can use the web browser to access the web network management system to manage devices.

    After the HTTPS service is enabled, the SSL handshake negotiation is triggered.

    After the http secure-server enable command is run, the HTTPS server accepts only login requests from MEth0/0/1 or VLANIF1 by default. To allow authorized users to log in to the HTTPS server from other interfaces, you should run the http server-source command to specify the source interface of the HTTPS server.

    After the http ipv6 secure-server enable command is run, the HTTPS server does not accept login requests from any IPv6 address by default, you should run the http ipv6 server-source command to specify the IPv6 source address for the HTTPS server.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Traditional HTTP service transmits data in plain text, which can be intercepted and tampered with. User identity cannot be authenticated, and the HTTP server cannot ensure online data security of applications such as the e-commerce and online banks. You can run the http secure-server ssl-policy command to configure an SSL policy for the HTTP server to encrypt data, authenticate user identity, and check message integrity to ensure data security during the web access.

Prerequisites

Before running the http secure-server ssl-policy command, you must first run the ssl policy command to create an SSL policy on the HTTP server.

Precautions

    The device provides a default SSL policy named Default. After the web page file is loaded to the device, the default SSL policy is loaded automatically, and you do not need to configure an SSL policy. To enhance device security, it is recommended that you obtain a new digital certificate from the CA and manually configure an SSL policy

    Only one SSL policy can be configured for the HTTP server, and the latest configured SSL policy takes effect.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If you need to manage and maintain devices on the graphical user interface (GUI), configure the Web network management function. When you need to update web page file when using the Web network management function, run this command to load web page file.

Prerequisites

Before loading the web page file using the http server load command, ensure that the web page file has been stored to the root directory of the storage device on the device; otherwise, file loading will fail.

Precautions

    If the system software is upgraded from V200R006 or an earlier version to V200R007 or a later version, but the target software version conflicts with the configuration file for next startup, the device will cancel the configuration of loading the web page file in the original system software after the upgrade, and loads the web page file integrated in the new system software by default.

    The web page file contains the SSL certificate, which is used to authenticate the HTTP server during login to ensure information security. When a user attempts to log in to the device through HTTP, the HTTPS login page is pushed to the user. After the user is authenticated, the system returns to the HTTP page. The SSL certificate is also used in the HTTPS login mode to ensure security of user information and data exchanged between the client and server. You can load a new digital certificate to the device.

    If the loaded web page file does not exist, the HTTP service cannot be enabled when the device restarts.

    To disable a loaded web page file, you must load another file.

-

In V200R020C00 and later versions, to allow authorized users to log in to the HTTP server through a non-management network port, run a command to specify the source interface of the HTTP server. For details about the command, see "Usage Scenario" in "Usage Guidelines" in this section.
Views

System view
Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In versions earlier than V200R020C00, an HTTP or HTTPS server receives connection requests from all interfaces by default, incurring security risks. For details, see the product documentation of the corresponding version.

In V200R020C00 and later versions, an HTTP or HTTPS server accepts only login requests from MEth0/0/1 or VLANIF1 by default. To allow authorized users to log in to the HTTP or HTTPS server, run either of the following commands to specify the source interface of the HTTP or HTTPS server.

    Run the http server-source -i interface-type interface-number command to configure a specified interface as the source interface of the HTTP or HTTPS server.
    Run the http server-source all-interface command to configure all interfaces configured with IPv4 addresses as the source interfaces of the HTTP or HTTPS server.

Prerequisites

Before you specify a logical interface as the source interface, ensure that the interface to be specified is created and has an IP address configured. Before you specify a physical interface as the source interface, ensure that the interface has an IPv4 address configured. Otherwise, the http server-source command cannot be successfully executed.

Configuration Impact

Users can log in to an HTTP or HTTPS server only from the specified source interface.

After you run http server-source command, the HTTP IPv4 user that has logged in to the server will be forcibly logged out and needs to log in again.

Precautions

After the source interface of an HTTP or HTTPS server is specified using the http server-source command, ensure that HTTP or HTTPS users can access the source interface at Layer 3. Otherwise, the HTTP or HTTPS users will fail to log in to the HTTP or HTTPS server.

After the http server-source all-interface command is run, the system allows HTTP or HTTPS users to log in to the HTTP or HTTPS server through all interfaces with IPv4 addresses configured. This increases system security risks. Therefore, you are not advised to run this command.
Example

# Specify loopback 0 as the source interface of an HTTP or HTTPS server.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] interface loopback 0
[HUAWEI-LoopBack0] quit
[HUAWEI] http server-source -i loopback 0

Info: Succeeded in starting the HTTP secure server.                                                                                 
Warning: HTTP is not a secure protocol, and it is recommended to use HTTPS.                                                         
Info: Succeeded in starting the HTTP server.

http ipv6 server-source
Function

The http ipv6 server-source command specifies an IPv6 source address for an HTTP or HTTPS server.

The undo http ipv6 server-source command cancels the IPv6 source address specified for an HTTP or HTTPS server.

By default, the IPv6 source address of an HTTP or HTTPS server is not specified.
Format

http ipv6 server-source -a ipv6_address [ -vpn-instance vpn_name ]

undo http ipv6 server-source

http ipv6 server-source all-interface
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

-a ipv6_address
	

Specifies the IPv6 source address for an HTTP or HTTPS server.
	

The total length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, which are divided into eight groups. Each group contains four hexadecimal digits. The value is in the format X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X.

-vpn-instance vpn_name
	

Specifies the name of a VPN instance.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 31 case-sensitive characters. It cannot contain spaces. The VPN instance name cannot be _public_. If the string is enclosed in double quotation marks (" "), the string can contain spaces.

In V200R020C00 and later versions, an HTTP or HTTPS server does not accept login requests from any interface by default. To allow authorized users to log in to the HTTP or HTTPS server, run either of the following commands to specify the source interface of the HTTP or HTTPS server.

    Run the http ipv6 server-source -a ipv6_address [ -vpn-instance vpn_name ] command to configure the specified IPv6 address as the IPv6 source address of the HTTP or HTTPS server.
    Run the http ipv6 server-source all-interface command to configure all interface IPv6 addresses on the device as the IPv6 source addresses of the HTTP or HTTPS server.

Prerequisites

A VPN instance has been created before you specify it for an HTTP or HTTPS server. Otherwise, the http ipv6 server-source command cannot be executed.

Configuration Impact

After an IPv6 source address is specified for an HTTP or HTTPS server, HTTP or HTTPS users can log in to the HTTP or HTTPS server only using this IPv6 address. This configuration applies to the HTTP or HTTPS users who attempt to log in to the server, not to the HTTP or HTTPS users who have logged in to the server.

Precautions

After an IPv6 source address is specified for an HTTP or HTTPS server using this command, ensure that HTTP or HTTPS users can access this IPv6 address at Layer 3. Otherwise, HTTP or HTTPS users will fail to log in to the HTTP or HTTPS server.

If the specified IPv6 source address is bound to a VPN instance, the HTTP or HTTPS server is also bound to the VPN instance.

After the http ipv6 server-source all-interface command is run, the system allows HTTP or HTTPS users to log in to the HTTP or HTTPS server through all interfaces with IPv6 addresses configured. This increases system security risks. Therefore, running this command is not recommended.
Example

# Specify the IPv6 source address 2001:DB8:: for an HTTP or HTTPS server.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] http ipv6 server-source -a 2001:DB8::

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

A maximum of five web users are supported at present. When the fifth web user logs in to the web server, any other user cannot log in to the web server even if any of the five users does not perform operations for a long time. The idle timeout duration is configured to release web resources in time. To occupy web channels for a long time, you must set the idle timeout duration to the maximum value.

Precautions

    After you run the http timeout command, the idle timeout durations are the same for all web users who log in to the web server. If the idle timeout duration expires, a user is disconnected from the web server and the web server notifies the user only after the user sends the next login request.

    If the http timeout command is configured several times, only the latest configuration takes effect.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To ensure that the remote host passes the validity check performed by the local host, the public key generated on the remote host must be saved to the local host. To save the public key, run the public-key-code begin command to enter the public key editing view and then enter the key. The key characters can contain spaces. You can also press Enter to enter data in another line.

Prerequisite

A key name has been specified using the rsa peer-public-key, dsa peer-public-key, or ecc peer-public-key command.

Precautions

    The public key must be a hexadecimal character string in the public key encoding format, and generated by the client or server that supports SSH.
    The public key displayed using the display rsa local-key-pair public, display dsa local-key-pair public, or display ecc local-key-pair public command can be used as the key data to enter.
    The last line of the key cannot contain only spaces and dsa-key; otherwise, the spaces at the beginning of the lines that are entered will be automatically deleted, and an error will be reported after the public-key-code end command is run.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario
After this command is run, editing the public key ends. Before saving the public key, the system will check the validity of the key.

    If there are illegal characters in the public key configured by the user, the system displays an error prompt. The public key is then discarded, and the configuration fails.
    If the public key configured is valid, it is saved in the public key chain table of the host.

Prerequisites

Before you run this command, the public-key-code begin command has been run to enter the public key edit view.

Precautions

    Generally, in the public key view, only the public-key-code end command can be used to exit. The quit command cannot be used.
    If no valid key coding is input, the key cannot be generated after the public-key-code end command is used. The system prompts that key generation fails.
    If the key has been deleted in another window, when you run the public-key-code end command, the system prompts that the key does not exist and returns to the system view.

Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To implement secure data exchange between the server and client, run the rsa local-key-pair create command to generate a local key pair.

Precautions

If the RSA key pair exists, the system prompts you to confirm whether to replace the original key pair. The keys in the new key pair are named device name_Server and device name_Host, for example, HUAWEI_Host and HUAWEI_Server. After being encrypted by AES256, the local RSA private key is saved to the hostkey and serverkey files in the system NOR FLASH.

After you run this command, the system prompts you to enter the number of bits in the host key. The difference between the bits in the server and host key pairs must be at least 128 bits. The length of the server or host key pair is 2048 ~ 4096 bits.

After you run this command, the generated key pair is saved in the device and will not be lost after the device restarts.

To improve security of the device, it is recommended that you use a key pair of 4096 bits.

This command is not saved in a configuration file.
Example

# Generate the local RSA host and server key pairs.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When you use an RSA public key for authentication, you must specify the public key of the corresponding client for an SSH user on the server. When the client logs in to the server, the server uses the specified public key to authenticate the client. You can also save the public key generated on the server to the client. Then the client can be successfully authenticated by the server when it logs in to the server for the first time.

Huawei data communications devices support the DER, OpenSSH and PEM formats for RSA keys. If you use an RSA key in non-DER/OpenSSH/PEM format, use a third-party tool to convert the key into a key in DER, OpenSSH or PEM format.

Because a third-party tool is not released with Huawei system software, RSA usability is unsatisfactory. In addition to DER, RSA keys need to support the privacy-enhanced mail (PEM) and OpenSSH formats to improve RSA usability.
Third-party software, such as PuTTY, OpenSSH, and OpenSSL, can be used to generate RSA keys in different formats. The details are as follows:

    The PuTTY generate RSA keys in PEM format.
    The OpenSSH generates RSA keys in OpenSSH format.
    The OpenSSL generates RSA keys in DER format.

OpenSSL is an open source software. You can download related documents at the OpenSSL official website.

After you configure an encoding format for an RSA public key, Huawei data communications device automatically generates an RSA public key in the configured encoding format and enters the RSA public key view. Then you can run the public-key-code begin command and manually copy the RSA public key generated on the peer device to the local device.

Prerequisite

The RSA public key in hexadecimal notation on the remote host has been obtained and recorded.

Follow-up Procedure
After you copy the RSA public key generated on the peer device to the local device, perform the following operations to exit the RSA public key view:

    Run the public-key-code end command to return to the RSA public key view.
    Run the peer-public-key end command to exit the RSA public key view and return to the system view.

Precautions

When you run the undo rsa peer-public-key command to delete a public key:

    If the public key has been assigned to an SSH client, run the undo ssh user user-name assign { rsa-key | dsa-key | ecc-key } command to release the binding between the public key and the SSH client. If you do not release the binding between them, the undo dsa peer-public-key command will fail to delete the public key.
    If the name of the host public key of the SSH server to be connected is specified on the SSH client, you need to run the undo ssh client servername assign { rsa-key | dsa-key | ecc-key } command to delete the host public key of the SSH server. Otherwise, the DSA public key cannot be deleted.

The peer public key supports only PKCS#1. Other PKCS versions are not supported.

ssh authentication-type default password
Function

The ssh authentication-type default password command configures password authentication as the default authentication mode for SSH users.

The undo ssh authentication-type default password command cancels the default password authentication mode for SSH users.

By default, the default authentication mode of SSH users is password authentication.
Format

Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When there are multiple SSH users, the default password authentication mode simplifies the configuration.

When a TACACS server is used to authenticate a user who uses SSH to log in to a device, the network administrator must specify the SSH user on the TACACS server. In most cases, the SSH server cannot obtain the user information from the TACACS server. In this situation, you can set the authentication mode to password. SSH users can then directly log in to the device without additional SSH user configurations on the device.

Precautions

To configure password authentication for a specific SSH user, you can also run the ssh user user-name authentication-type password command.
Example

# Configure password authentication as the default authentication mode for SSH users.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] ssh authentication-type default password

ssh authorization-type default aaa
Function

The ssh authorization-type default aaa command configures the AAA authorization function for the SSH public key authentication user.

The undo ssh authorization-type default aaa command cancels the AAA authorization function configured for the SSH public key authentication user.

By default, the AAA authorization function is not configured for the SSH public key authentication user.
Format

ssh authorization-type default aaa

Parameters

None
Views

System view
Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines
Usage Scenario

The SSH public key authentication user is an SSH user that uses the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), or digital signature algorithm (DSA) authentication mode.

If the AAA authorization function is not configured for the SSH public key authentication user, the SSH public key authentication user uses the level of the involved VTY channel. After the AAA authorization function is configured for the SSH public key authentication user, if the authorization succeeds, the SSH public key authentication user uses the level returned by the AAA. If the authorization fails, the user still uses the level of the involved VTY channel.
Precautions
AAA authorization configuration succeeds for the SSH public key authentication user if the following conditions are met:

    A local authorization scheme is configured for the default domain of the AAA management user.
    A local user exists, and the SSH access type is configured.

Example

# Configure the AAA authorization function for the SSH public key authentication user.

Specifies the SSH server public key name that has been configured on an SSH client.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 30 case-insensitive characters without spaces.
Views

System view
Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If an SSH client connects to an SSH server for the first time and first authentication is not enabled on the SSH client using the ssh client first-time enable command, the SSH client must determine whether the server is reliable. To do so, run the ssh client assign command to specify the host public key of the SSH server and the mapping between the key and SSH server on the SSH client. The client then uses the correct public key to determine whether the server is reliable based on the mapping.

Precautions

The name of the RSA, DSA, or ECC public key to be assigned to the SSH server must be the same as that configured on the SSH client. This public key must have been configured on the SSH server using the rsa peer-public-key, dsa peer-public-key, or ecc peer-public-key command. If either of the preceding conditions is not met, RSA, DSA, or ECC public key authentication of the SSH server fails on the SSH client.

To improve security, it is not recommended that you use RSA or DSA as the authentication algorithm.
Example
# Assign the DSA public key to the SSH server.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] ssh client 10.164.39.120 assign dsa-key sshdsakey01

# Delete the DSA public key of the SSH server.

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

An SSH server and a client need to negotiate an encryption algorithm for the packets exchanged between them. You can run the ssh client cipher command to configure an encryption algorithm list for the SSH client. After the SSH server receives a packet from the client, the server matches the encryption algorithm list of the client against its local list and selects the first matched encryption algorithm. If no encryption algorithm matches, the negotiation fails.

Precautions

The following encryption algorithms are listed in descending order of security level: aes256_ctr and aes128_ctr.

The system software does not support the aes256_cbc, aes128_cbc, 3des_cbc, and des_cbc parameters. To use these parameters, you need to install the WEAKEA plug-in. To ensure high security, you are advised to configure the aes256_ctr or aes128_ctr parameter. For details about how to install the WEAKEA plug-in, see WEAKEA Configuration.
In V200R019C00 and later versions, when the device starts with the default configurations, it automatically performs the following configurations and saves the configurations to the configuration file:

    Run the ssh server dh-exchange min-len 2048 command to set the minimum key length supported during Diffie-hellman-group-exchange key exchange between the SSH server and client to 2048 bytes.
    Run the ssh server cipher aes256_ctr aes128_ctr command to configure CTR encryption algorithms for an SSH server.
    Run the ssh server hmac sha2_256 command to configure the HMAC SHA2_256 algorithm for an SSH server.
    Run the ssh client cipher aes256_ctr aes128_ctr command to configure CTR encryption algorithms for an SSH client.
    Run the ssh client hmac sha2_256 command to configure the HMAC SHA2_256 algorithm for an SSH client.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When an SSH client accesses an SSH server for the first time and the public host key of the SSH server is not configured on the SSH client, run the ssh client first-time enable command to enable the first authentication function. The SSH client then can access the SSH server and save the public host key on the SSH client. When the SSH client accesses the SSH server next time, the saved public host key is used to authenticate the SSH server.

Precautions

To log in to the SSH server successfully at the first time, you can also run the ssh client assign command to pre-assign a public host key to the SSH server. When you use STelnet or SFTP to connect to the server, you need to specify the public key authentication algorithm for server authentication as the ECC, RSA, or DSA key algorithm.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

An SSH server and a client need to negotiate a key exchange algorithm for the packets exchanged between them. You can run the ssh client key-exchange command to configure a key exchange algorithm list for the SSH client. The server compares the key exchange algorithm list sent by the client with its own key exchange algorithm list, and selects the first key exchange algorithm on the client's list that matches a key exchange algorithm on its own list as the key exchange algorithm for packet transmission. If no algorithm on the client's list matches an algorithm on the server's list, the negotiation fails.

Precautions

The following key exchange algorithms are listed in descending order of security level: dh_group_exchange_sha256, ecdh_sha2_nistp521, ecdh_sha2_nistp384, ecdh_sha2_nistp256, dh_group16_sha512, dh_group15_sha512, and dh_group14_sha256.

The system software does not contain the dh_group_exchange_sha1, dh_group14_sha1, and dh_group1_sha1 parameters. To use these parameters, you need to install the WEAKEA plug-in. However, the algorithms specified by these parameters are less secure. For higher security purposes, you are advised to use other parameters. For details about how to install the WEAKEA plug-in, see WEAKEA Configuration.

The higher the security level of a key exchange algorithm, the longer the time required by the device to calculate the key.
Example

# Add two key exchange algorithms dh_group_exchange_sha256 and dh_group14_sha256 to the key exchange algorithm list of the SSH client.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When the SSH session duration reaches the specified interval at which key renegotiation is triggered, the system renegotiates a key and uses the new key to establish SSH session connections, improving system security.

If the time parameter is configured for an SSH client, the client sends a key renegotiation packet to the server to renegotiate an encryption key when the SSH session duration reaches the specified interval.

If the data-limit parameter is configured for an SSH client, the client sends a key renegotiation packet to the server to renegotiate an encryption key when the size of sent and received data exceeds the maximum value.

If the max-packet parameter is configured for an SSH client, the client sends a key renegotiation packet to the server to renegotiate an encryption key when the number of sent and received packets exceeds the maximum value.

Precautions

A key renegotiation request is initiated when either an SSH client or server meets the key renegotiation criteria. After one party initiates such a request, the other party responds.

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

You can run this command to specify a public key algorithm for an SSH server. In this case, the SSH server cannot use other public key algorithms, improving device security. The ECC public key algorithm is recommended.

If a public key algorithm is specified in the ssh server publickey command, the SSH server can use the specified public key algorithm and cannot use other public key algorithms. For example, if the ssh server publickey dsa command is run, the SSH server can use the DSA algorithm and cannot use the ECC and RSA algorithms.

Precautions

A client can log in to an SSH server using a public key algorithm only if the server also uses this public key algorithm.

For security purposes, you are not advised to use the RSA algorithm with the key of less than 2048 bits to authenticate SSH users. Instead, you are advised to use the more secure ECC, RSA_SHA2_256, or RSA_SHA2_512 authentication algorithm.

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When the SSH session duration reaches the specified interval at which key renegotiation is triggered, the system renegotiates a key and uses the new key to establish SSH session connections, improving system security.

After the time parameter is configured for an SSH server, the SSH server checks each SSH session. If the session duration reaches the interval, the SSH server sends a key renegotiation packet to the client to renegotiate an encryption key.

After the data-limit parameter is configured for an SSH server, the SSH server checks each SSH session. If the size of data sent and received by the SSH server through a session exceeds the maximum value, the SSH server sends a key renegotiation packet to the client to renegotiate an encryption key.

After the max-packet parameter is configured for an SSH server, the SSH server checks each SSH session. If the number of packets sent and received by the SSH server through a session exceeds the maximum value, the SSH server sends a key renegotiation packet to the client to renegotiate an encryption key.

Precautions

A key renegotiation request is initiated when either an SSH client or server meets the key renegotiation criteria. After one party initiates such a request, the other party responds.

Usage Scenario

In versions earlier than V200R020C00, an SSH server accepts login connection requests from all interfaces by default, leading to low system security. For details, see the product documentation of the corresponding version.

In V200R020C00 and later versions, an SSH server does not accept login connection requests from any interface by default. To authorize users to log in to the server, run either of the following commands to specify the source interface of the SSH server:

    Run the ssh server-source -i interface-type interface-number command to configure a specified interface as the source interface of the SSH server.
    Run the ssh server-source all-interface command to specify any interface with an IPv4 address configured on the device as the source interface of the SSH server.

Prerequisites

Before specifying a logical interface as the source interface, ensure that the source interface has been created and has an IPv4 address configured. Otherwise, this command cannot be executed successfully.

Precautions

After this command is run, the new configuration takes effect upon the next login.

After the source interface is specified, the system allows users to log in to the SSH server only using the specified source interface. This configuration applies to the SSH users who attempt to log in to the SSH server, but not to the SSH users who have logged in to the server.

After the source interface of an SSH server is specified using this command, ensure that authorized SSH users can access the source interface at Layer 3. Otherwise, the SSH users will fail to log in to the SSH server.

If the source address or source interface is not specified, there are security risks.

When the ssh server-source -i command is run, if a VLANIF interface is specified as the source interface and has a secondary address configured, SSH login using the secondary address is not supported.

After the ssh server-source all-interface command is run, the system allows SSH users to log in to the SSH server through all interfaces with IPv4 addresses configured. This increases system security risks. Therefore, you are not advised to run this command.
Example

# Specify Loopback0 as the source interface of an SSH server.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] interface loopback 0
[HUAWEI-LoopBack0] ip address 10.1.1.1 24
[HUAWEI-LoopBack0] quit
[HUAWEI] ssh server-source -i loopback 0

ssh ipv6 server-source
Function

The ssh ipv6 server-source command specifies an IPv6 source address for an SSH server.

The undo ssh ipv6 server-source command cancels the IPv6 source address specified for an SSH server.

By default, the IPv6 source address of an SSH server is not specified.
Format

ssh ipv6 server-source -a ipv6_address [ -vpn-instance vpn_name ]

undo ssh ipv6 server-source

ssh ipv6 server-source all-interface
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

-a ipv6_address
	

Specifies the IPv6 source address for an SSH server.
	

The total length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, which are divided into eight groups. Each group contains four hexadecimal digits. The value is in the format X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X.

-vpn-instance vpn_name
	

Specifies the name of a VPN instance.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 31 case-sensitive characters. It cannot contain spaces. The VPN instance name cannot be _public_. If the string is enclosed in double quotation marks (" "), the string can contain spaces.

all-interface
	

Indicates that any interface IPv6 address on the device can be used as the IPv6 source address of the SSH server.

In V200R020C00 and later versions, an SSH server does not accept login requests from any IPv6 address by default. To allow authorized users to log in to the SSH server, run either of the following commands to specify an IPv6 source address for the SSH server.

    Run the ssh ipv6 server-source -a ipv6_address [ -vpn-instance vpn_name ] command to configure the specified IPv6 address as the IPv6 source address of the SSH server.
    Run the ssh ipv6 server-source all-interface command to configure all interface IPv6 addresses on the device as the IPv6 source addresses of the SSH server.

Prerequisites

A VPN instance has been created before you specify it for an SSH server. Otherwise, the ssh ipv6 server-source command cannot be executed.

Configuration Impact

After an IPv6 source address is specified for an SSH server, SSH users can log in to the SSH server only using this IPv6 address. This configuration applies to the SSH users who attempt to log in to the SSH server, not to the SSH users who have logged in to the server.

Precautions

After this command is run, the new configuration takes effect upon the next login.

After an IPv6 source address is specified for an SSH server using this command, ensure that SFTP or SSH users can access this IPv6 address at Layer 3. Otherwise, SFTP or SSH users will fail to log in to the SSH server.

If the specified IPv6 source address is bound to a VPN instance, the SSH server is also bound to the VPN instance.

After the ssh ipv6 server-source all-interface command is run, the system allows SSH users to log in to the SSH server through all interfaces with IPv6 addresses configured. This increases system security risks. Therefore, running this command is not recommended.
Example

# Specify the IPv6 source address 2001:DB8:: for an SSH server.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] ssh ipv6 server-source -a 2001:DB8::

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

When an SSH client needs to log in to the SSH server in RSA, DSA, or ECC mode, run the ssh user assign command to assign a public key to the client. If the client has been assigned keys, the latest assigned key takes effect.

Precautions

The newly configured public key takes effect upon next login.

If the user named user-name to whom a public key is assigned does not exist, the device automatically creates an SSH user named user-name and performs the configured authentication for the SSH user.

To improve security, it is not recommended that you use RSA or DSA as the authentication algorithm.
Example

# Assign key1 to the user named John.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] ssh user john assign rsa-key key1

ssh user authorization-cmd aaa
Function

The ssh user authorization-cmd aaa command enables command line authorization for an SSH user.

Usage Scenario

When you configure an authentication mode for an SSH user, if the user does not exist, a device automatically creates an SSH user named user-name.

Table 2-45 describes the usage scenarios for different authentication modes.
Table 2-45 Usage scenarios for authentication modes

Authentication Mode
	

Usage Scenario

RSA
	

It is a public key encryption architecture and an asymmetric encryption algorithm. RSA is mainly used to transmit the keys of the symmetric encryption algorithm, which improves encryption efficiency and simplify key management. The server checks whether the SSH user, public key, and digital user signature are valid. If all of them are valid, the user is permitted to access the server. If any of them is invalid, the authentication fails, and the user is denied to access the server.

DSA
	

It is same as RSA authentication in implementation. The server checks whether the SSH user, public key, and digital user signature are valid. If all of them are valid, the user is permitted to access the server. If any of them is invalid, the authentication fails, and the user is denied to access the server.
Compared with RSA authentication, DSA authentication uses the digital signature algorithm for encryption and has a wider application scope.

    Many SSH tools only support DSA authentication for servers and clients.
    Based on the latest RFC recommendation for SSH, DSA authentication takes precedence over RSA authentication.

ECC
	
Like RSA authentication, the server first checks the validity of the SSH user and whether the public key and the numeric signature are valid. If all of them are consistent with those configured on the server, user authentication succeeds. If any of the three cannot pass authentication, the user access is denied. Compared with the RSA algorithm, the ECC authentication has the following advantages:

    Provides the same security with shorter key length.
    Features a shorter computing process and higher processing speed.
    Requires less storage space.
    Requires lower bandwidth.

password
	

On the server, the AAA module assigns each authorized user a password for login. The server has the mapping between user names and passwords. When a user requests to access the server, the server authenticates the user name and password. If either of them fails to be authenticated, the access request of the user is denied.

The account information of users who are configured with the password authentication mode can be configured on devices or remote authentication servers (for example, RADIUS servers).

password-rsa, password-dsa, and password-ecc
	

The SSH server authenticates a client by checking both the public key and password. The client can be authenticated only when both the public key and password meet the requirement.

all
	

The SSH server authenticates a client by checking the public key or password. The client can be authenticated when either the public key or password meets the requirement.

Precautions

A new SSH user cannot log in to the SSH server unless being configured with an authentication mode. The newly configured authentication mode takes effect upon next login.

To improve security, it is not recommended that you use RSA or DSA as the authentication algorithm.
Example

# Configure password authentication for the SSH user John.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] ssh user john authentication-type password

ssh user service-type
Function

The ssh user service-type command configures a service type for an SSH user.

The undo ssh user service-type command restores the default service type for an SSH user.

By default, no service type is configured for an SSH user.
Format

ssh user user-name service-type { sftp | stelnet | all }

undo ssh user user-name service-type
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

user-name
	

Specifies the SSH user name.
	
The value is a string of 1 to 64 case-insensitive characters without spaces.
NOTE:

The string can contain spaces if it is enclosed with double quotation marks (").

sftp
	

Specifies the SFTP service type.
	

-

stelnet
	

Specifies the STelnet service type.
	

-

all
	

Specifies the SFTP and STelnet service types.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To configure a service type for an SSH user, run the ssh user service-type command on a device. If the specified user does not exist, the device creates an SSH user who has the same name as the specified user and uses the configured service type for the SSH user.

Precautions

If the SFTP service type is configured for an SSH user, you need to run the ssh user sftp-directory command to set an authorized directory for the user. By default, the SFTP service authorized directory is flash: for the SSH user.
Example

# Configure the all service type for an SSH user John.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

Logins through Telnet bring security risks because Telnet does not provide any authentication mechanism and data is transmitted using TCP in plain text. Compared with Telnet, SSH guarantees secure file transfer on a traditional insecure network by authenticating clients and encrypting data in bidirectional mode. The SSH protocol supports STelnet. You can run this command to use STelnet to log in to another device from the current device.

STelnet is a secure Telnet service. SSH users can use the STelnet service in the same way as the Telnet service.

When a fault occurs in the connection between the client and server, the client needs to detect the fault in real time and proactively release the connection. You need to set the interval for sending keepalive packets and the maximum number of times on the client that logs in to the server through STelnet.

    Interval for sending keepalive packets: If a client does not receive any packet within the specified interval, the client sends a keepalive packet to the server.
    Maximum number of times the server has no response: If the number of times that the server does not respond exceeds the specified value, the client proactively releases the connection.

Precautions

    Before connecting the SSH server using the STelnet command, run the stelnet server enable command to enable the STelnet service on the SSH server.

    If the server is listening on port 22, the SSH client can log in to the SSH server with no port specified. If the server is listening on another port, the port number must be specified upon login.

Example

# Set keepalive parameters when a client logs in to a server through STelnet.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] stelnet 10.164.39.209 -ki 10 -kc 4

# Remotely connect to the STelnet server that uses an IPv6 address.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To connect a client to an SSH server through STelnet, you must enable the STelnet service on the SSH server.

Prerequisites

Before enabling the STelnet service, run either of the following commands as required:

    Run the ssh server-source -i interface-type interface-number command to configure a specified interface as the source interface of the SSH server or run the ssh server-source all-interface command to specify any interface with an IPv4 address configured on the device as the source interface of the SSH server.
    Run the ssh ipv6 server-source -a ipv6_address [ -vpn-instance vpn_name ] command to configure a specified IPv6 address as the IPv6 source address of the SSH server or run the ssh ipv6 server-source all-interface command to specify any interface IPv6 address on the device as the IPv6 source address of the SSH server.

Precautions

After you disable the STelnet service on the SSH server, all clients that have logged in through STelnet are disconnected.

After the stelnet server enable command is run, the numbers of IPv4 port and IPv6 port are both changed. To change the IPv4 or IPv6 port number separately, run the stelnet { ipv4 | ipv6 } server enable command.
Example

# Enable the STelnet service.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] stelnet server enable

# Enable the STelnet IPv4 service.

super
Function

The super command changes the user's current privilege level.

User privilege level indicates the type of the login user. There are 16 user privilege levels. Different from the use of command privilege level, a login user can only use the commands with the levels no higher than the user privilege level.
Format

super [ level ]
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

level
	

Specifies the user privilege level.
	

The value is an integer ranging from 0 to 15. By default, the level is 3.

Default Level

0: Visit level
Usage Guidelines

User privilege level indicates the type of the login user. There are 16 user privilege levels. Different from the use of command privilege level, a login user can only use the commands with the privilege levels no higher than the user privilege level.

In order to prevent unauthorized users from illegal intrusion, user ID authentication is performed when users at a lower level switch to users at a higher level. In other word, the password of the higher level is needed. You can run the super password command to set the password for changing the user from a lower level to a higher level.

For the sake of confidentiality, the password the user inputs is not shown on the screen. The user can switch to the higher level only when inputting the correct password within three times. Otherwise, the original user privilege level remains unchanged.
The passwords must meet the following requirements:

    The password is a string of 8 to 16 case-sensitive characters.

    The password must contain at least two of the following characters: upper-case character, lower-case character, digit, and special character. Special character except the question mark (?) and space.

Huawei switches use the combination of user name, password, and level to control users' operation rights. If you use the super command to switch user privilege levels, this right control method will become invalid. Moreover, any user can use the super password of a higher level to obtain high-level operation rights. Therefore, you are not advised to use the super command to switch user privilege levels.
Example

# Enable the user to switch to level 3.

<HUAWEI> super 3

Password:

Now user privilege is 3 level, and only those commands whose level is equal to or less than this level can be used.

Privilege note: 0-VISIT, 1-MONITOR, 2-SYSTEM, 3-MANAGE

super password
Function

The super password command sets the password for switching a user from a lower level to a higher level.

The undo super password command deletes the password for switching a user from a lower level to a higher level.

By default, no password is configured for switching a user from a lower level to a higher level. A password must be configured for switching a user from a lower level to a higher level. Otherwise, the switching fails.
Format

super password [ level user-level ] [ cipher password ]

undo super password [ level user-level ]
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

level user-level
	

Specifies the user privilege level that needs to be changed.
	

The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 15. By default, the system sets a password for a user that switches to level 3.

cipher password
	

Specifies the password for changing a level.
	

    When cipher is not entered, password input is in man-machine interaction mode, and the system does not display the entered password.

    The password is a string of 8 to 16 case-sensitive characters. The password must contain at least two of the following characters: upper-case character, lower-case character, digit, and special character.

    Question mark (?) and space characters are not supported.

    When cipher is entered, the password is displayed in either simple or ciphertext mode during input.
        When being input in simple mode, the password requirements are the same as those when cipher is not entered.
        When being input in ciphertext, the password must be a string of 56 consecutive characters.
    NOTE:

    If the source version supports a ciphertext password which is a string of 24 or 32 characters, the target version also supports this type of password.

    When setting the password for switching the user privilege level, if the current user privilege level is higher than the specified user privilege level and the password exists, the old password does not need to be verified. If the current user privilege level is lower than the specified user privilege level, enter the correct old password; otherwise, the configuration will fail.

    The password is displayed in ciphertext in the configuration file regardless of whether it is input in simple or ciphertext mode.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If users' rights are redefined, users need to run the super command to change their levels from low to high. For safety, users need to be authenticated when they change their levels. Users can run the super password command to set the password of changing their levels from low to high for authentication.

Precautions

    The password entered by a user is saved in ciphertext, irrespective of whether cipher is specified. Therefore, if the password is lost, you cannot get it back.
    Users can press Ctrl+C to cancel the operation when they run the super password.

    When a user with a level lower than the level configured using this command queries the password configured using the display this or display current-configuration command, the password is displayed as asterisks (******).

Example
# Set the password Abcd@123 for switching a user from a lower level to level 3, with cipher configured for the password.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] super password level 3 cipher Abcd@123

Info: The password will be changed, please verify the old password.

super password complexity-check disable
Function

The super password complexity-check disable command disables password complexity check when a low-level user is switched to a high-level user.

The undo super password complexity-check disable command enables password complexity check when a low-level user is switched to a high-level user.

By default, password complexity check is enabled when a low-level user is switched to a high-level user.
Format

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

The device has the following requirements for the password for switching a low-level user to a high-level user:

    By default, the minimum password length is eight characters. If the password length set by the set password min-length command exceeds eight characters, the value set by this command is the minimum password length.

    A password must contain two or more types of characters, such as upper-case letters, lower-case letters, digits, and special characters.

    The special characters exclude question marks (?) and spaces.

To ensure security of the password for switching a low-level user to a high-level user, run the undo super password complexity-check disable command to enable password complexity check. In this case, if a specified password fails the password complexity check, the configuration does not take effect. In a scenario where high security is not required, run the super password complexity-check disable command to disable password complexity check.

Precautions

If password complexity check is disabled when a low-level user is switched to a high-level user, a simple password will bring security risks.
Example

# Disable password complexity check when a low-level user is switched to a high-level user.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

If multiple devices on a network need to be configured and managed, run the telnet command to log in to these devices from your terminal for remote device configuration, facilitating device management.

You can press Ctrl+K to terminate an active connection between the local and remote devices.

Precautions

    Before you run the telnet command to connect to the Telnet server, the Telnet client and server must be able to communicate at Layer 3 and the Telnet service must be enabled on the Telnet server.

    Logins through Telnet bring security risks because Telnet does not provide any authentication mechanism and data is transmitted using TCP in plain text. The STelnet mode is recommended for networks that have high security requirements.

Example

# Connect to a remote device through Telnet.

<HUAWEI> telnet 192.168.1.6

# Use the IPv6 address to connect to a remote device through Telnet.

<HUAWEI> telnet ipv6 fc00:0:0:11::158

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

In versions earlier than V200R020C00, a Telnet server receives connection requests from all interfaces by default, incurring security risks. For details, see the product documentation of the corresponding version.

In V200R020C00 and later versions, a Telnet server does not accept login requests from any interface by default. To allow authorized users to log in to the Telnet server, run either of the following commands to specify the source interface of the Telnet server.

    Run the telnet server-source -i interface-type interface-number command to configure a specified interface as the source interface of the Telnet server.
    Run the telnet server-source all-interface command to configure all interfaces configured with IPv4 addresses as the source interfaces of the Telnet server.

Prerequisites

Before you specify a logical interface as the source interface, ensure that the interface to be specified is created and has an IP address configured. Before you specify a physical interface as the source interface, ensure that the interface has an IPv4 address configured. Otherwise, the telnet server-source command cannot be successfully executed.

Precautions

By default, no source interface is specified for an SSH server.

After the source interface is specified, a device allows Telnet users to log in to the Telnet server only through this source interface, and Telnet users logging in through other interfaces are denied. Note that setting this parameter only affects Telnet users who attempt to log in to the Telnet server, and it does not affect Telnet users who have logged in to the server.

After the source interface of a Telnet server is specified using this command, ensure that Telnet users can access the source interface at Layer 3. Otherwise, the Telnet users will fail to log in to the Telnet server.

No source address or source interface is specified, so security risks exist.

After the telnet server-source all-interface command is run, the system allows Telnet users to log in to the Telnet server through all interfaces with IPv4 addresses configured. This increases system security risks. Therefore, you are not advised to run this command.
Example

# Specify loopback0 as the source interface of the Telnet server.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] interface loopback 0

[HUAWEI-LoopBack0] ip address 10.1.1.1 24

[HUAWEI-LoopBack0] quit

[HUAWEI] telnet server-source -i loopback 0

telnet ipv6 server-source
Function

The telnet ipv6 server-source command specifies an IPv6 source address for a Telnet server.

The undo telnet ipv6 server-source command cancels the IPv6 source address specified for a Telnet server.

By default, the IPv6 source address of a Telnet server is not specified.
Format

telnet ipv6 server-source -a ipv6_address [ vpn-instance vpn_name ]

undo telnet ipv6 server-source

telnet ipv6 server-source all-interface
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

-a ipv6_address
	

Specifies the IPv6 source address for a Telnet server.
	

The total length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, which are divided into eight groups. Each group contains four hexadecimal digits. The value is in the format X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X.

vpn-instance vpn_name
	

Specifies the name of a VPN instance.
	

The value is a string of 1 to 31 case-sensitive characters. It cannot contain spaces. The VPN instance name cannot be _public_. If the string is enclosed in double quotation marks (" "), the string can contain spaces.

all-interface
	

Indicates that any interface IPv6 address on the device can be used as the IPv6 source address of the Telnet server.
	

-

In V200R020C00 and later versions, a Telnet server does not accept login connection requests from any IPv6 address by default.

Usage Scenario

In versions earlier than V200R020C00, a Telnet server accepts connection requests from all IPv6 addresses by default, incurring security risks. For details, see the product documentation of the corresponding version.

In V200R020C00 and later versions, a Telnet server does not accept login requests from any IPv6 address by default. To allow authorized users to log in to the Telnet server, run either of the following commands to specify an IPv6 source address for the Telnet server.

    Run the telnet ipv6 server-source -a ipv6_address [ vpn-instance vpn_name ] command to configure the specified IPv6 address as the IPv6 source address of the Telnet server.
    Run the telnet ipv6 server-source all-interface command to configure all interface IPv6 addresses on the device as the IPv6 source addresses of the Telnet server.

Prerequisites

A VPN instance has been created before you specify it for a Telnet server. Otherwise, the telnet ipv6 server-source command cannot be executed.

Configuration Impact

After an IPv6 source address is specified for a Telnet server, Telnet users can log in to the Telnet server only using this IPv6 address. This configuration applies to the Telnet users who attempt to log in to the server, not to the Telnet users who have logged in to the server.

Precautions

After this command is run, the new configuration takes effect upon the next login.

After an IPv6 source address is specified for a Telnet server using this command, ensure that Telnet users can access this IPv6 address at Layer 3. Otherwise, Telnet users will fail to log in to the Telnet server.

If the specified IPv6 source address is bound to a VPN instance, the Telnet server is also bound to the VPN instance.

After the telnet ipv6 server-source all-interface command is run, the system allows Telnet users to log in to the Telnet server through all interfaces with IPv6 addresses configured. This increases system security risks. Therefore, running this command is not recommended.
Example

# Specify the IPv6 source address 2001:DB8:: for a Telnet server.

<HUAWEI> system-view
[HUAWEI] telnet ipv6 server-source -a 2001:DB8::

telnet server enable
Function

The telnet server enable command enables the Telnet service.

The undo telnet server enable command disables the Telnet service.

The telnet server disable command disables the Telnet service.

By default, the Telnet service is disabled.
Format

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

You can run the telnet server enable command to enable the Telnet service. A Telnet server can be connected only when it is enabled.

Prerequisites

Before enabling the Telnet service, run either of the following commands as required:

    Run the telnet server-source -i interface-type interface-number command to configure a specified interface as the source interface of the Telnet server or run the telnet server-source all-interface command to specify any interface with an IPv4 address configured on the device as the source interface of the Telnet server.
    Run the telnet ipv6 server-source -a ipv6_address [ -vpn-instance vpn_name ] command to configure a specified IPv6 address as the IPv6 source address of the Telnet server or run the telnet ipv6 server-source all-interface command to specify any interface IPv6 address on the device as the IPv6 source address of the Telnet server.

Precautions

If the user who logged in to the server through Telnet is online, the undo telnet [ ipv6 ] server enable command fails to be run on the server.

When a Telnet server is disabled, you can log in to the device only through the console port or SSH.

The Telnet protocol poses a security risk, and therefore using STelnet V2 is recommended.
Example

# Enable the Telnet service.

<HUAWEI> system-view

[HUAWEI] telnet server enable

telnet server port
Function

The telnet server port command configures a listening port number for a Telnet server.

The undo telnet server port command restores the default listening port of a Telnet server.

The default listening port of a Telnet server is 23.
Format

telnet server port port-number

undo telnet server port
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value
port-number 	Specifies the listening port number of a Telnet server. 	The value is an integer that is 23 or ranges from 1025 to 55535. The default value 23 is the standard Telnet server port number.
Views

Default Level

3: Management level
Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To prevent attackers from attacking the standard Telnet listening port number, run the telnet server port command to configure a new listening port. This improves security.

Precautions

If the server is listening on port 23, the Telnet client can log in successfully with no port specified. If the server is listening on another port, the port number must be specified.

Before changing the current port number, disconnect all devices from the port. After the port number is changed, the server starts to listen on the new port.
Example

# Set the listening port number to 1026.
