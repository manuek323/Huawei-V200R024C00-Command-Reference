ipv6 route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid
Function

The ipv6 route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command disables a switch from selecting an IPv6 static route if the BFD session associated with the route is in the AdminDown state.

The undo ipv6 route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command restores the default configuration.

By default, an IPv6 static route can participate in route selection even if the BFD session associated with it is in the AdminDown state.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

By default, if a BFD session associated with an IPv6 static route is in the AdminDown state, the route can participate in route selection on Huawei switches, but is not allowed for route selection on some non-Huawei devices. As a result, Huawei switches cannot communicate with such non-Huawei devices.

To address this problem, run the ipv6 route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command to configure the switch not to select the IPv6 static route if the BFD session associated with it is in the AdminDown state.

Prerequisites

The BFD session specified by bfd-name has been created.

Precautions

The undo ipv6 route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command enables all IPv6 static routes to participate in route selection even if the BFD sessions associated with them are in the AdminDown state.
Example

# Disable a switch from selecting an IPv6 static route if the BFD session associated with the route is in the AdminDown state.
