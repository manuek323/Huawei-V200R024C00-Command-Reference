display remote-unit port realtime
Function

The display remote-unit port realtime command displays real-time information about interfaces on an RU.
Format

display remote-unit port { connect-interface interface-type interface-number | name remote-unit-name } realtime
Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

connect-interface interface-type interface-number
	

Specifies the type and number of an interface connecting the central switch to an RU. The interface type and number can be closely next to each other or separated by a space character.
	

-

name remote-unit-name
	

Specifies the alias of an RU.
	

The value must be an existing RU alias.

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

To monitor interfaces on a specific RU or locate faults on interfaces, you can run the display remote-unit port realtime command to view real-time information about the interfaces, including the physical status, auto-negotiation status, working mode, and rate.

Precautions

    An uplink 2.5GE optical interface of an RU does not support a copper module, and supports only a GE or 2.5GE optical module. In V200R022C10 and earlier versions, the uplink interface configured with a GE optical module can connect to a central switch only when it works at the rate of 1 Gbit/s. In V200R023C00 and later versions, the uplink interface configured with a 2.5GE optical module can connect to a central switch when it works at the rate of 2.5 Gbit/s. After the rate of the uplink interface is changed, the RU automatically restarts for the change to take effect.
    An uplink 2.5GE hybrid optical-electrical interface of an RU does not support a copper module, and supports only a GE or 2.5GE optical or hybrid module. In V200R022C10 and earlier versions, the uplink interface configured with a GE optical or hybrid module can connect to a central switch only when it works at the rate of 1 Gbit/s. In V200R023C00 and later versions, the uplink interface configured with a 2.5GE optical or hybrid module can connect to a central switch when it works at the rate of 2.5 Gbit/s. After the rate of the uplink interface is changed, the RU automatically restarts for the change to take effect.
