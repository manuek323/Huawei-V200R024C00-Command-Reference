poe power-on delay port
Function

The poe power-on delay port command sets the power supply delay for an interface on an RU.

The undo poe power-on delay port command restores the default power supply delay for an interface on an RU.

By default, the power supply delay for an interface on an RU is 0, which indicates no delay.

Parameters
Parameter 	Description 	Value

Usage Guidelines

Usage Scenario

As the holding current of a non-standard PD is insufficient at the power-on moment, an RU assumes that the PD has been disconnected and powers it off.

To solve this problem, you can set the power supply delay for RU interfaces on the central switch. When the delay expires, the RUs detect the holding current to ensure that non-standard PDs can be properly powered on.

Follow-up procedure

After running this command, run the commit command to make the configuration take effect.

Precautions

If a PD is connected to an interface configured with a power supply delay, do not replace the PD within the delay. Otherwise, the new PD cannot work properly.
Example

# Set the power supply delay to 5 seconds for interface 1 on RU 0.
